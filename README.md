# OpenClawOnNixOS

OpenClawOnNixOS is the next-generation workspace for building OpenClaw as an AI-native control plane on top of NixOS.

The first milestone focuses on a minimal "body loop":

- persistent local control plane
- observable AI work view
- screen sensing
- screen actions
- browser runtime
- basic system sensing and healing

## Repository Layout

```text
apps/       User-facing applications such as the observer UI
services/   Background services that form the control plane
packages/   Shared types, events, clients, and utilities
nix/        NixOS modules, profiles, hosts, and helper scripts

```

## First-Phase Services

- `openclaw-core`
- `openclaw-event-hub`
- `openclaw-session-manager`
- `openclaw-screen-sense`
- `openclaw-screen-act`
- `openclaw-browser-runtime`
- `openclaw-system-sense`
- `openclaw-system-heal`
- `observer-ui`

## Status

The repository now includes the first runnable service pair:

1. `openclaw-event-hub`
2. `openclaw-core`

## Quick Start

Bring the full local control plane up with ordered startup and health checks:

```bash
npm run dev:up
```

On Linux / NixOS:

```bash
npm run dev:up:unix
```

The Unix launcher keeps health checks on `127.0.0.1`, but it now binds the services to `0.0.0.0` so the observer UI and backend ports can be reached from the host machine through the VM IP as well.

- Inside the VM, use `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
- From the host machine, use `http://<vm-ip>:<port>`

Verify the current health matrix:

```bash
npm run dev:check
```

On Linux / NixOS:

```bash
npm run dev:check:unix
```

Run a reproducible state-settling check for `warming_up -> ready -> degraded`:

```bash
npm run dev:state-check

## Screen Capture Adapter Shell

`openclaw-screen-sense` now supports a first capture-adapter shell:

- `OPENCLAW_SCREEN_CAPTURE_MODE=browser`
  uses `openclaw-browser-runtime /browser/capture`
- `OPENCLAW_SCREEN_CAPTURE_MODE=command`
  runs an external command and expects JSON screen payload

Windows-friendly option:

- `OPENCLAW_SCREEN_CAPTURE_POWERSHELL_FILE`
  runs `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <script>`
- `OPENCLAW_SCREEN_CAPTURE_NODE_FILE`
  runs `node <script>`

The external command contract is:

```json
{
  "source": "command",
  "snapshotPath": "D:/captures/frame.txt",
  "snapshotText": "captured text",
  "focusedWindow": { "title": "App", "pid": 1234 },
  "windowList": [{ "title": "App", "pid": 1234 }],
  "ocrBlocks": [{ "text": "captured text", "confidence": 0.95 }]
}
```

Example adapter script:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\nix\scripts\example-screen-capture.ps1
```

File-backed example adapter:

```powershell
node .\nix\scripts\file-screen-capture.mjs
```

Example environment for command mode:

```powershell
$env:OPENCLAW_SCREEN_CAPTURE_MODE="command"
$env:OPENCLAW_SCREEN_CAPTURE_NODE_FILE="$PWD\\nix\\scripts\\file-screen-capture.mjs"
```

The file-backed example reads these environment variables:

- `OPENCLAW_CAPTURE_SNAPSHOT_TEXT_FILE`
- `OPENCLAW_CAPTURE_OCR_TEXT_FILE`
- `OPENCLAW_CAPTURE_WINDOW_TITLE`
- `OPENCLAW_CAPTURE_WINDOW_PID`
- `OPENCLAW_CAPTURE_SNAPSHOT_PATH`

## Migration Reality

Development can continue on Windows with relatively low migration cost, but not
literally zero cost.

What should migrate cleanly:

- control-plane services
- HTTP contracts
- readiness / degraded semantics
- capture adapter contract

What will still change on NixOS/Linux:

- startup scripts
- filesystem paths
- desktop capture commands
- OCR tooling
- window enumeration tooling

That is why the current architecture keeps platform-specific capture logic in
external adapters. The intended Linux starting point is:

```bash
./nix/scripts/linux-screen-capture.sh
```

## Linux Capture Strategy

There are now two separate Linux capture tracks:

1. Mainline track: AI work view capture
2. Experimental track: whole-desktop GNOME/Wayland capture

The current recommendation for NixOS is:

- treat browser/runtime-backed capture as the stable path
- treat external file/command capture as the stable extension point
- treat whole-desktop GNOME/Wayland capture as experimental

This is based on real NixOS VM validation:

- `dev:up:unix` works
- `dev:check:unix` works
- `dev:state-check:unix` works
- `dev:body-config-check:unix` covers the first NixOS body module and systemd skeleton
- `dev:command-capture-check:unix` works
- `dev:milestone-check:unix` is the preferred mainline regression suite
- `dev:operator-control-check:unix` covers operator dry-run, pause gating, and resume
- `dev:policy-check:unix` covers the first policy governance and cross-boundary gate
- `dev:sovereign-body-policy-check:unix` covers body-internal autonomy under `OPENCLAW_AUTONOMY_MODE=sovereign_body`
- `dev:sovereign-command-execute-check:unix` covers allowlisted body-internal command execution under sovereign body autonomy
- `dev:sovereign-command-chain-check:unix` covers multi-step command execution transcripts under sovereign body autonomy
- `dev:sovereign-command-branch-check:unix` covers branching command execution from previous transcript results
- `dev:sovereign-command-recovery-check:unix` covers non-zero command exit recovery and default command task failure
- `dev:sovereign-command-ledger-check:unix` covers queryable command transcript ledger and restart recovery
- `dev:sovereign-filesystem-write-check:unix` covers bounded autonomous filesystem text writes under sovereign body autonomy
- `dev:sovereign-filesystem-workspace-check:unix` covers autonomous directory creation, file write, and metadata verification chains
- `dev:sovereign-filesystem-ledger-check:unix` covers queryable filesystem change ledger and restart recovery

- `dev:observer-command-ledger-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for the cross-task command transcript ledger
- `dev:observer-filesystem-ledger-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for the cross-task filesystem change ledger
- `dev:observer-filesystem-read-ledger-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for the cross-task filesystem read access ledger
- `dev:observer-workspace-detect-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for read-only OpenClaw workspace detection
- `dev:observer-workspace-command-proposals-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for OpenClaw workspace command proposals
- `dev:observer-workspace-command-plan-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for OpenClaw workspace command plan drafts
- `dev:observer-workspace-command-task-check:unix` covers Observer controls for approval-gated OpenClaw workspace command tasks
- `dev:observer-workspace-command-execute-check:unix` covers Observer controls and visibility for approved OpenClaw workspace command execution
- `dev:observer-workspace-command-failure-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for failed OpenClaw workspace command execution
- `dev:capability-planner-check:unix` covers capability-aware plan metadata and approval-gated body capabilities
- `dev:capability-invoke-check:unix` covers policy-governed capability invocation through core
- `dev:capability-history-check:unix` covers persistent capability invocation history and restart recovery
- `dev:capability-operator-check:unix` covers operator execution through governed capability invocation
- `dev:capability-approval-operator-check:unix` covers operator approval waiting before high-risk capability execution
- `dev:observer-capability-plan-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for body capability decisions inside plans
- `dev:observer-capability-invoke-check:unix` covers Observer controls for policy-governed capability invocation
- `dev:observer-capability-history-check:unix` covers Observer visibility for persistent capability invocation history
- `dev:system-sense-check:unix` covers real body vitals and service health telemetry
- `dev:system-heal-check:unix` covers conservative diagnosis, autofix, and heal history
- `dev:openclaw-workspace-command-proposals-check:unix` covers proposal-only command shapes for detected OpenClaw workspaces
- `dev:openclaw-workspace-command-plan-check:unix` covers plan-only execution drafts for selected OpenClaw workspace commands
- `dev:openclaw-workspace-command-task-check:unix` covers approval-gated task materialization for selected OpenClaw workspace commands
- `dev:openclaw-workspace-command-execute-check:unix` covers approved execution of allowlisted OpenClaw workspace commands
- `dev:openclaw-workspace-command-failure-check:unix` covers failure capture for approved OpenClaw workspace commands
- direct GNOME/Wayland whole-desktop capture remains inconsistent across:
  - `org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot`
  - `grim`
  - `gnome-screenshot`
  - `xdg-desktop-portal Screenshot`

So the current Linux collector should be understood as an experiment shell, not
the core product path.

The experimental Linux collector currently tries tools in this order:

- screenshots:
  - `xdg-desktop-portal Screenshot` via `gdbus monitor` + `gdbus call`
  - `org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot` via `gdbus`
  - `grim`
  - `gnome-screenshot`
  - `import`
- focused window / window list:
  - `gdbus` with `org.gnome.Shell`
  - `xdotool`
  - `wmctrl`
- OCR:
  - `tesseract`
