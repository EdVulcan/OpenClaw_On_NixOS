# OpenClaw Documentation Control Room

Updated: 2026-07-16

This is the active documentation entry point for `OpenClawOnNixOS`.

The project has many historical phase plans. Do not use the largest phase number
as the next task. Start from the active route below.

## Start Here

Read in this order:

1. [Forward Work Directive](./OPENCLAW_FORWARD_WORK_DIRECTIVE.md)
2. [Enhanced Source Migration Brief](./plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_MIGRATION_BRIEF.md)
3. [System Identity Upgrade Path](./architecture/OPENCLAW_SYSTEM_IDENTITY_UPGRADE_PATH.md)
4. [Kernel-Level Evolution Whitepaper](./architecture/KERNEL_LEVEL_EVOLUTION_WHITEPAPER.md)
5. [Plans Directory Guide](./plans/README.md)

## Current Project Correction

The project is not fundamentally off-course, but the recent provider/credential
phase ladder has become too fine-grained. The active route is now:

```text
preserve enhanced openclaw source on GitHub
-> audit which enhanced capabilities are already absorbed
-> migrate Claude Code-grade engineering capabilities as governed body tools
-> close Level 1 operator execution-consistency and declared/runtime capability boundaries
-> return to identity-upgrade work: work-view/session helper, then hostd
```

Do not continue with Phase 137-style provider wrappers unless the next slice
creates a real capability and explicitly passes the progress test in the forward
directive.

## Historical Phase Plans

`docs/plans/OPENCLAW_PHASE_*_PLAN.md` files are retained because many milestone
scripts still read them as evidence fixtures. They are not active next-work
instructions.

Do not delete, rename, or move them until the milestone scripts that reference
them are refactored.

## Guides And Evidence

| Document | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [OPENCLAW_MVP_DEMO_GUIDE.md](./guides/OPENCLAW_MVP_DEMO_GUIDE.md) | Historical MVP demo guide; still referenced by milestone checks. |
| [OPENCLAW_MVP_STATUS.md](./guides/OPENCLAW_MVP_STATUS.md) | Historical MVP status; still referenced by milestone checks. |
| [OPENCLAW_MVP_FINAL_READINESS.md](./guides/OPENCLAW_MVP_FINAL_READINESS.md) | Historical MVP final readiness; still referenced by milestone checks. |
| [fix_log.md](./guides/fix_log.md) | Historical diagnosis and repair log. |
| [HANDOVER_SUMMARY.md](./HANDOVER_SUMMARY.md) | Historical handoff for the decoupling/restructure era. |

## Documentation Cleanup Policy

- Active guidance must be linked from this file.
- Historical evidence may remain in place when milestone checks reference it.
- Do not create a new numbered phase just to continue a pattern.
- Prefer updating an active route document when correcting direction.
- If a document becomes obsolete but is referenced by tests, mark it historical
  in the index rather than moving it.
