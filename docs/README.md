# NixSoma Documentation Control Room

Updated: 2026-07-19

This is the canonical entry point for current NixSoma development. Historical
OpenClaw names remain in service identifiers, environment variables, milestone
registries, and evidence documents because they are compatibility contracts.

Do not select work from the largest phase number or an old `Next Slice`
paragraph. Reconcile this baseline with the repository and live host first.

## Current Baseline

| Layer | Evidence at this checkpoint | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capability source | Current `main` through the Level 3 fixed-unit incident loop, resource-pressure observation, and declarative cgroup envelope | Implemented; commit history is authoritative |
| Local validation | 893 workspace tests and typecheck pass; body-config, provider flake check, native inventory, and event-audit integration pass; 811 registry entries pass | Validated |
| Continuous integration | GitHub CI runs Node 22 install, typecheck, workspace tests, milestone registry/script audit, and Windows path budget on pushes and pull requests | Configured in source |
| Installed system | NixOS `26.05.4808.569d57850992`, generation `/nix/store/6dm12j7y7mj7chwaqq13nkwgd0v91v8c-nixos-system-nixos-26.05.4808.569d57850992` | Resource envelopes and governed DeepSeek sender deployed and probed 2026-07-19 |
| Previous generation | `/nix/store/j5zj2b2z9yf3d7wkmmbwy9qf5m3dv1bj-nixos-system-nixos-26.05.4808.569d57850992` | Superseded without rollback or reboot |
| Deployed resource envelopes | System body: 1.5/3 GiB and 1024 tasks; user session: 1.5/3 GiB and 1024 tasks; all assigned services active | Deployed and probed without pressure injection |
| Provider runtime | Fixed DeepSeek endpoint/model; root-only source delivered by `LoadCredential`; `LIVE_EGRESS=1`; one 252-token request-bound advisory completed | Deployed and proven without prompt, reason, or credential persistence |
| Deployed journal probe | Bounded `/system/systemd/journal-evidence` returns live read-only JSON; `openclaw-system-sense` has the `systemd-journal` supplementary group | Deployed and probed |
| Deployed scheduler | First five-minute tick recorded all three fixed targets healthy with no incident task | Deployed and probed |
| Deployed audit store | Current Event Hub package is active; retention and rotation remain source-validated without destructive live rehearsal | Deployed |
| Privileged actions | Physical-host generation switch and governed provider egress are proven; real repair, hostd activation, and rollback | Remaining mutations deferred to explicit/disposable checks |

The current checkout is on the only available physical host
(`systemd-detect-virt=none`). Historical VM results remain acceptance evidence,
not an available execution environment.

The enhanced-source migration brief and gap audit are retained as source and
migration evidence. They are no longer instructions to repeat preservation or
the initial capability audit.

## Current Frontier

The completed bounded frontier is:

- Level 1 operator authentication, sensitive-read protection, per-service
  identity, exact execution grants, reservation recovery, and governed
  engineering read/edit/write/verify/recovery workflows.
- Level 2 trusted browser/work-view observation, semantic action, takeover,
  recovery, and Observer control within the bounded AI-owned workspace.
- Level 3 independent hostd ownership, exact Polkit and peer boundaries, three
  fixed systemd repair targets, read-only eBPF process evidence, bounded journal
  diagnosis, and target-specific post-repair application health receipts in
  source.
- Phase D candidate generation, approval-bound staging/build, real closure
  receipt, independent host-health oracle, controlled activation contract,
  manual rollback evidence, and a physical-host-safe failure rehearsal.
- Explicitly approved DeepSeek context handoff and structured engineering-plan
  recommendation without automatic task creation, execution, or provider use.
- Exact request-bound DeepSeek diagnosis handoff for a verified terminal
  systemd incident receipt, with journal messages and private runtime details
  excluded and no recommendation-driven repair authority.
- Local target-specific incident experience recording and recall through the
  existing advisory Context Packet and Observer owners.
- Up to three safe prior matching-target patterns inside the exact approved
  incident diagnosis request, with execution-time drift rejection.
- One operator-reviewed provider action that opens only the exact bound terminal
  incident receipt and recovery evidence in existing Observer task detail.
- One operator-reviewed provider action that refreshes body health, fixed-unit
  inventory, and bounded journal evidence for that exact incident unit.
- One compact hash-bound local receipt for that reviewed observation, excluding
  journal messages and provider output and carrying no repair authority.
- One operator-created, approval-bound fresh diagnosis from that observation
  receipt, with execution-time drift rejection and exact observation readback.
- One five-minute local scheduler for the three fixed hostd targets, with
  compact audited incident tasks, restart-safe dedupe, recovery re-arming, and
  existing Observer task-detail visibility.
- Automatic local triage that binds each current scheduler incident's source
  task, fingerprint, and fixed unit to the existing read-only repair draft and
  creates or reuses a completed evidence task without approval or execution.
- Automatic repair promotion that revalidates the triage/source/current
  scheduler chain and creates or reuses the existing fixed-target real repair
  task with one pending approval, without approval resolution or hostd
  invocation.
- One approval-triggered dispatch coordinator that revalidates and reserves the
  exact automatic repair task, then enters the existing Executor once with
  automatic recovery disabled. The systemd handler rejects automatic tasks
  without that reservation.
- Restart reconciliation that aligns terminal dispatch state and fails every
  missing or non-terminal reservation closed without Executor/hostd replay.

Real repair execution and rollback remain unproven on a disposable mutation
environment. Level 4 graphics-stack ownership remains future work.

## Active Route

The Event Hub development-log blocker is closed in validated source. Tail
queries read fixed-size blocks newest-first, summaries stream once and then
update incrementally, writes rotate at 64 MiB, and eight rotated segments are
retained by default. A legacy oversized segment is preserved on first rotation
instead of being silently truncated. Against the current 438 MiB development
log, a 200-event tail query took about 41 ms and the first full summary about
1.9 s with roughly 20 MiB heap; a cached repeat took 0 ms.

The Level 3 incident and guidance loop is complete in source:

```text
body health + bounded journal evidence
-> bounded diagnosis
-> existing fixed restart owner
-> post-repair health verification
-> task and Observer evidence
-> approved compact incident handoff
-> transient engineering_recommendation_v0 guidance
-> local matching-target incident experience recall
-> approved diagnosis informed by bounded prior outcomes
-> reviewed opening of the exact bound incident evidence
-> reviewed same-unit read-only observation refresh
-> compact hash-bound local observation receipt
-> exact approval-bound observation diagnosis
-> reviewed opening of the exact observation task
-> periodic local fixed-unit observation
-> deduplicated completed incident task in Observer
-> automatic local triage bound to the current repair draft
-> automatic promotion into one pending fixed-target repair approval
-> explicit operator approval or denial
-> one-shot approved dispatch through the existing fixed hostd executor
-> post-repair health and incident receipt
```

Do not broaden hostd into arbitrary systemd control or add another provider
readiness wrapper. The validated source baseline is now deployed: all service
health probes returned 200, anonymous protected reads/mutations returned 401,
the journal endpoint is live, Observer contains both incident controls, and the
first scheduler tick observed all fixed targets healthy. Automatic low-risk
local triage, pending repair promotion, one-shot dispatch after explicit
approval, and fail-closed restart reconciliation are complete in source. This
source baseline is deployed at
`/nix/store/yzjwwp67apgv4rrzpm3g2gz12bqkq7vj-nixos-system-nixos-26.05.4808.569d57850992`.
The switch restarted only Core; all eight system and two user services remained
active with zero restarts, the live Core closure matched the candidate, and the
first new scheduler tick left all three targets healthy with no task or
approval change. Real repair, provider egress, hostd mutation, and generation
rollback remain deferred to an explicit or disposable mutation check. Freeze
this completed lane and select the next concrete whitepaper capability.

The next Level 3 capability is deployed. Native systemd inventory reports
bounded current/peak memory, effective soft and hard limits, CPU use, task
counts, and managed OOM evidence, while the existing Observer panel renders the
same read-only telemetry and four-sample trend. The desktop profile declares two
independent
cgroup envelopes: seven ordinary system body services use
`openclaw-body.slice`, and session-manager, browser-runtime, and trusted
sidecars use `openclaw-session.slice`. Each has 1.5 GiB `MemoryHigh`, 3 GiB
`MemoryMax`, and `TasksMax=1024`; hostd and credential initializers remain
outside the envelopes. Generation `9bbc00da...` passed generated-unit and
closure review before activation, then runtime slice, service, health,
restart-count, auth, failed-unit, and journal probes after activation. Its Core
unit established the disabled provider baseline. Current generation `6dm12j7...`
now loads the separately provisioned root-only key through systemd
`LoadCredential` and has completed one exact approval-bound advisory call. The
call persisted only hashes, usage, and compact recommendation evidence; prompt,
reason, and credential content remained transient. A deliberate memory-pressure
test on the sole physical host remains out of scope. Freeze both the resource
and provider-transport lanes. Next design the smallest budgeted standing
advisory policy that cannot create approvals or execute actions automatically.

## Windows Checkout Path Policy

Run `bash nix/scripts/dev-windows-path-budget-check.sh` before committing. The
repository-relative path budget is 160 characters. Public milestone names,
capability IDs, endpoint paths, and audit tokens remain unchanged; only physical
filenames may use manifest-backed short aliases.

Use a short checkout directory on Windows. `git -c core.longpaths=true clone`
may add headroom, but it is not a substitute for the repository path budget.

## Historical Evidence

The files under `docs/plans/` include historical phase plans referenced by
milestone scripts. Do not delete, rename, or move them until those references
are migrated. Historical `Next Slice` sections are evidence of earlier route
decisions, not current instructions.

Useful historical indexes:

- [Enhanced Source Migration Brief](./plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_MIGRATION_BRIEF.md)
- [Enhanced Source Gap Audit](./plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_GAP_AUDIT.md)
- [MVP Demo Guide](./guides/OPENCLAW_MVP_DEMO_GUIDE.md)
- [Handover Summary](./HANDOVER_SUMMARY.md)

## Documentation Policy

- Update this baseline when capability source and installed generation diverge.
- Keep one active route and one next real capability.
- Prefer updating an existing decision record over creating a numbered phase.
- Mark completed plans as historical evidence instead of leaving them Active.
- Record source, validation, deployment, and privileged-mutation status
  separately.
