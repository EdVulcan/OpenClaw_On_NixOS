# NixSoma Documentation Control Room

Updated: 2026-07-18

This is the canonical entry point for current NixSoma development. Historical
OpenClaw names remain in service identifiers, environment variables, milestone
registries, and evidence documents because they are compatibility contracts.

Do not select work from the largest phase number or an old `Next Slice`
paragraph. Reconcile this baseline with the repository and live host first.

## Current Baseline

| Layer | Evidence at this checkpoint | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capability source | Current `main` through the Level 3 incident repair loop and bounded Event Hub audit storage | Implemented; commit history is authoritative |
| Local validation | 830 workspace tests and typecheck pass; body-config and event-audit integration pass; 811 registry entries pass | Validated |
| Installed system | NixOS `26.05.4808.569d57850992`, generation `/nix/store/735kfj8knq1nn092hq4z57sjlc9di3q5-nixos-system-nixos-26.05.4808.569d57850992` | Running but behind the capability source |
| Deployed journal probe | `/system/systemd/journal-evidence` returns `404`; `openclaw-system-sense` has no `systemd-journal` supplementary group | Not deployed |
| Deployed audit store | Installed Event Hub predates streaming tail reads, cached summaries, and rotation | Not deployed |
| Privileged actions | Real hostd activation, generation switch, and rollback | Deferred unless a separate mutation environment is explicitly authorized |

The current checkout is on the only available physical host
(`systemd-detect-virt=none`). Historical VM results remain acceptance evidence,
not an available execution environment.

## Start Here

Read in this order:

1. [Forward Work Directive](./OPENCLAW_FORWARD_WORK_DIRECTIVE.md)
2. [System Identity Upgrade Path](./architecture/OPENCLAW_SYSTEM_IDENTITY_UPGRADE_PATH.md)
3. [Kernel-Level Evolution Whitepaper](./architecture/KERNEL_LEVEL_EVOLUTION_WHITEPAPER.md)
4. [Native Engineering Tool Surface](./plans/OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_TOOL_SURFACE_PLAN.md)
5. [D-Bus And Fixed Systemd Control](./plans/OPENCLAW_DBUS_NATIVE_SYSTEMD_CONTROL_PLAN.md)
6. [Phase D Declarative Evolution](./plans/OPENCLAW_PHASE_D_DECLARATIVE_EVOLUTION_CANDIDATE_PLAN.md)
7. [Plans Directory Guide](./plans/README.md)

The enhanced-source migration brief and gap audit are retained as source and
migration evidence. They are no longer instructions to repeat preservation or
the initial capability audit.

## Current Frontier

The completed bounded frontier is:

- Level 1 operator authentication, sensitive-read protection, per-service
  identity, exact execution grants, reservation recovery, and governed
  engineering read/edit/write/verify/recovery workflows.
- Level 2 trusted browser/work-view observation, semantic action, takeover,
  recovery, and Observer control within the bounded AI-owned workspace.
- Level 3 independent hostd ownership, exact Polkit and peer boundaries, three
  fixed systemd repair targets, read-only eBPF process evidence, bounded journal
  diagnosis, and target-specific post-repair application health receipts in
  source.
- Phase D candidate generation, approval-bound staging/build, real closure
  receipt, independent host-health oracle, controlled activation contract,
  manual rollback evidence, and a physical-host-safe failure rehearsal.
- Explicitly approved DeepSeek context handoff and structured engineering-plan
  recommendation without automatic task creation, execution, or provider use.
- Exact request-bound DeepSeek diagnosis handoff for a verified terminal
  systemd incident receipt, with journal messages and private runtime details
  excluded and no recommendation-driven repair authority.
- Local target-specific incident experience recording and recall through the
  existing advisory Context Packet and Observer owners.
- Up to three safe prior matching-target patterns inside the exact approved
  incident diagnosis request, with execution-time drift rejection.
- One operator-reviewed provider action that opens only the exact bound terminal
  incident receipt and recovery evidence in existing Observer task detail.
- One operator-reviewed provider action that refreshes body health, fixed-unit
  inventory, and bounded journal evidence for that exact incident unit.

Real generation activation and rollback remain unproven on a disposable
mutation environment. Level 4 graphics-stack ownership remains future work.

## Active Route

The Event Hub development-log blocker is closed in validated source. Tail
queries read fixed-size blocks newest-first, summaries stream once and then
update incrementally, writes rotate at 64 MiB, and eight rotated segments are
retained by default. A legacy oversized segment is preserved on first rotation
instead of being silently truncated. Against the current 438 MiB development
log, a 200-event tail query took about 41 ms and the first full summary about
1.9 s with roughly 20 MiB heap; a cached repeat took 0 ms.

The Level 3 incident and guidance loop is complete in source:

```text
body health + bounded journal evidence
-> bounded diagnosis
-> existing fixed restart owner
-> post-repair health verification
-> task and Observer evidence
-> approved compact incident handoff
-> transient engineering_recommendation_v0 guidance
-> local matching-target incident experience recall
-> approved diagnosis informed by bounded prior outcomes
-> reviewed opening of the exact bound incident evidence
-> reviewed same-unit read-only observation refresh
```

Do not broaden hostd into arbitrary systemd control or add another provider
readiness wrapper. The next real capability is one compact hash-bound local
receipt for the reviewed refreshed observation. It must not retain journal
messages, add hostd mutation, automatic provider calls, or a new response
schema.

## Progress Estimate

These figures are capability-maturity estimates, not test coverage:

| Scope | Current estimate |
| --- | --- |
| Level 1 user-space control plane | about 90% |
| Level 2 bounded trusted work view | 95-100% |
| Level 3 controlled system body | about 45% |
| Level 4 graphics-stack-native body | 0-5% |
| Current bounded product scope | 75-80% |
| Final whitepaper vision | 45-55% |

## Windows Checkout Path Policy

Run `bash nix/scripts/dev-windows-path-budget-check.sh` before committing. The
repository-relative path budget is 160 characters. Public milestone names,
capability IDs, endpoint paths, and audit tokens remain unchanged; only physical
filenames may use manifest-backed short aliases.

Use a short checkout directory on Windows. `git -c core.longpaths=true clone`
may add headroom, but it is not a substitute for the repository path budget.

## Historical Evidence

The files under `docs/plans/` include historical phase plans referenced by
milestone scripts. Do not delete, rename, or move them until those references
are migrated. Historical `Next Slice` sections are evidence of earlier route
decisions, not current instructions.

Useful historical indexes:

- [Enhanced Source Migration Brief](./plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_MIGRATION_BRIEF.md)
- [Enhanced Source Gap Audit](./plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_GAP_AUDIT.md)
- [MVP Demo Guide](./guides/OPENCLAW_MVP_DEMO_GUIDE.md)
- [Handover Summary](./HANDOVER_SUMMARY.md)

## Documentation Policy

- Update this baseline when capability source and installed generation diverge.
- Keep one active route and one next real capability.
- Prefer updating an existing decision record over creating a numbered phase.
- Mark completed plans as historical evidence instead of leaving them Active.
- Record source, validation, deployment, and privileged-mutation status
  separately.
