# OpenClaw Forward Work Directive

Updated: 2026-07-14

This is the active guidance document for continuing OpenClaw development after
the Phase 136 checkpoint and the discovery that the locally optimized
`openclaw` source has not yet been preserved on GitHub or migrated into
`OpenClawOnNixOS`.

Use this document as the first stop for new agents. Historical phase plans and
milestone checks remain valuable evidence, but they must not be treated as an
automatic instruction to continue with Phase 137.

## Current Diagnosis

The project has not fundamentally drifted from the whitepaper:

- The NixOS body has a service skeleton and resident control plane.
- The AI work-view route exists through session, browser, screen-sense, and
  screen-act services.
- Body health, conservative self-heal, systemd repair, evidence ledgers, and
  Observer visibility exist.
- Memory, cloud-consciousness, provider-call, and result-envelope routes have
  strong governance evidence.
- The core and Observer have been decoupled significantly since the earlier
  giant-file phase.

The risk is local drift:

- Phase 59 through Phase 136 became too dominated by nested cloud-provider,
  credential, local-read, result-envelope, approved-deferred, and readiness
  gates.
- Some of those gates are valid sovereignty boundaries, but continuing that
  pattern mechanically would create more shell/checklist work than product
  capability.
- The locally enhanced `openclaw` source contains real Claude Code-grade
  engineering improvements that are not yet stored in GitHub and not yet
  integrated as native OpenClaw body capabilities.

## Governing Vision

The controlling architecture documents are:

```text
docs/architecture/OPENCLAW_SYSTEM_IDENTITY_UPGRADE_PATH.md
docs/architecture/KERNEL_LEVEL_EVOLUTION_WHITEPAPER.md
docs/plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_MIGRATION_BRIEF.md
```

The identity route is:

```text
stable user-space control plane
-> trusted session/work-view component
-> controlled system-level body daemon
-> graphics-stack-native AI workspace
-> later kernel-level body nerves
```

Do not root-ify the whole system. Do not try to take over the full user desktop
as the main route. First make OpenClaw stable, observable, useful, and capable
inside its own body and work-view.

## Immediate Stop Rule

Do not continue with another generic cloud/provider/credential phase unless it
unlocks an actual live capability that has been explicitly selected after this
directive.

In particular, do not create a Phase 137 that only adds another:

```text
route
task shell
approved-deferred record
final-readiness preflight
readback wrapper
observer mirror
```

Those patterns are allowed only when they are the smallest necessary slice for a
new product capability.

## First Required Work: Use Preserved Enhanced Source

The optimized Windows-host `openclaw` source is now preserved on GitHub as a
source reference for migration.

```text
repository: https://github.com/EdVulcan/openclaw-enhanced-source
branch: main
commit: d90b253b0c03191613e45c36b1434078b8788bed
```

This repository is a reference source, not a dependency to wholesale import.

Original Windows source working tree:

```text
D:\OpenclawAndClaudecode\openclaw
```

Observed important source material:

```text
extensions/cc-tools/
src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/microcompact.ts
src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.ts
src/agents/pi-tools.ts
src/agents/system-prompt.ts
src/plugins/runtime/runtime-registry-loader.ts
src/plugins/runtime/runtime-registry-loader.test.ts
src/auto-reply/reply/commands-plugins.ts
src/auto-reply/reply/commands-plugins.test.ts
src/auto-reply/reply/commands-plugins.install.test.ts
extensions/acpx/src/codex-auth-bridge.ts
extensions/acpx/src/runtime-persistence.test.ts
ui/index.html
ui/src/styles/
HEARTBEAT.md
SOUL.md
TOOLS.md
gateway-architecture.html
```

Do not preserve accidental local state unless the human explicitly asks:

```text
.openclaw/workspace-state.json
help.txt
temp_test.txt
```

Preferred VM inspection command:

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/openclaw-enhanced-source
git clone https://github.com/EdVulcan/openclaw-enhanced-source.git /tmp/openclaw-enhanced-source
cd /tmp/openclaw-enhanced-source
git checkout d90b253b0c03191613e45c36b1434078b8788bed
```

Preservation note:

```text
The first push preserved the full enhanced-source branch history from the local
openclaw checkout. GitHub reported one large historical cache file warning:
.serena/cache/typescript/document_symbols.pkl is 83.22 MB. Do not treat that
cache file as migration material.
```

The next step is not more preservation. The next step is the gap audit.

## Second Required Work: Enhanced Source Gap Audit

After the enhanced source is preserved, perform a source-integration gap audit.
The audit must classify every enhanced capability as one of:

```text
absorbed
partially absorbed
not absorbed
should not migrate
requires source transfer
```

Minimum capability list:

```text
cc_read / precise file read
cc_edit / surgical string replacement
cc_write / controlled new-file or overwrite path
cc_glob and cc_grep / fast codebase navigation
cc_lsp / definition, references, hover
cc_verify / verification loop and command evidence
cc_plan_enter, cc_plan_exit, cc_todo_write / planning state
microcompact / in-memory old tool-result compaction
live plugin runtime refresh
ACPX/Codex bridge compatibility and persistence tests
engineering prompt semantics
operator-facing UI refinements
identity notes: HEARTBEAT, SOUL, TOOLS
```

The audit output should become a new document:

```text
docs/plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_GAP_AUDIT.md
```

## Third Required Work: Select Real Capability Slices

After the audit, the recommended trunk is:

```text
Native governed engineering tool surface
```

The first slices should move in this order:

1. Read-only tool inventory and contract mapping.
2. Native governed read/search surface.
3. Surgical edit proposal with diff preview, not raw write.
4. Verification command evidence attached to task completion.
5. Observer visibility and recovery evidence.
6. Microcompact as context-management evidence, not hidden transcript mutation.
7. Live plugin runtime refresh as a governed lifecycle action.
8. Planning/todo evidence as visible task/workbench state, not hidden mode.
9. LSP availability, lifecycle evidence, governed process probes, lifecycle
   state, and initialize/shutdown handshake before any source-content transfer
   or symbol request.

Only after these are proven should the project continue deeper cloud-provider
execution work.

## Current Evidence-Based Frontier

The Level 1 native engineering route now has bounded read/search, proposal,
approval-gated edit/write, ledger, verification, recovery, LSP selected-target,
planning workbench, governed suggested-action creation, and compact linked task
readback. It also has a bounded microcompact transformation for caller-owned
in-memory message copies, with recent verification/recovery context protected
and no persisted transcript mutation. A local Engineering Context Packet now
assembles bounded task/transcript context with credential-like redaction and
protected verification/recovery summaries without provider use. Do not reopen completed LSP symbol-request slices or add another
standalone engineering evidence/readiness shell without a concrete operator gap.

The approved DeepSeek handoff and recommendation bridge are now bounded by the
existing egress task. Task creation records only a redacted binding containing
the allowlisted endpoint fingerprint, model, exact
`openclaw://credential/deepseek-api-key` reference, request hash, optional
context hash, response contract, and egress authorization flags. `/operator/step`
rebuilds that binding and rejects any mismatch before the credential or network
sender runs. The sender rejects non-DeepSeek credential references and HTTP
redirects. Recommendations remain review-only and cannot create a task,
approval, execution, or provider egress automatically.

The same approved handoff now accepts explicit `includeWorkView`,
`includeWorkViewObservation`, and `includePlanTodo` context selectors. It
reuses the existing local association and plan/todo builders, includes only
bounded summaries in the transient provider message, and carries their
materialized content through the existing request-hash binding. Raw page
payloads, URLs, pixels, target items, selectors, input values, lease ids, and
credentials remain excluded. The focused boundary is documented in
`docs/plans/OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_CONTEXT_PROVIDER_HANDOFF_BRIDGE_PLAN.md`.

The handoff also accepts an explicit `sourceTaskId` so the approved provider
egress task can consume bounded evidence from an existing engineering task.
The source task must exist, remains read-only, and is never resumed or mutated;
the egress task remains the approval and execution owner. This continuity
boundary is documented in
`docs/plans/OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_CONTEXT_PROVIDER_SOURCE_TASK_PLAN.md`.

The next autonomous product route is the smallest real Level 2 trusted AI
work-view/session-helper behavior. Keep helper installation, root/system daemon
work, desktop-wide capture, unapproved provider egress, and arbitrary endpoint
execution deferred until their runtime owner and authority boundary are explicit.

The first Level 2 runtime slice is now active: session-manager owns an in-process
AI work-view helper lease and browser-runtime must echo the same session/lease
before the helper contract reports `active`. Continue by carrying that lease
through existing browser action mediation; do not replace it with another
readiness endpoint.

That action-mediation follow-up is complete for browser input and click:
screen-act derives the current trusted lease, browser-runtime rejects missing or
mismatched leases before mutation, and Observer shows the mediation result.
Operator takeover now suspends the same lease in session-manager and
browser-runtime; explicit resume rotates and rebinds a new lease before actions
continue. The existing approved sidecar lifecycle now starts and stops one
bounded independent user-session process whose current-user socket heartbeat
backs lease readiness. Unexpected exit and heartbeat timeout fail closed by
suspending browser action authority; the same approved lifecycle action
explicitly reconnects a survivor or starts a replacement and rebinds a new
lease, with no automatic restart or reconnect. The Level 2
sidecar now continuously refreshes a bounded browser observation over an
allowlisted loopback-only source, with single-flight polling, sequence, and
fresh/stale state but no retained full payload. Screen-act now requires a fresh
same-session sidecar observation alongside the helper lease after sidecar
lifecycle activation. Bounded browser input/click now travels through the
sidecar socket, rechecks capture/session, and returns through screen-act audit.
Session-manager restart persists only compact lifecycle intent; the sidecar
survives but clears its authority binding and capture, while the new manager
revokes the stale browser lease before listening and reports
`recovery_required`. The existing approved task explicitly reconnects the same
PID under a fresh session lease. Browser-runtime restart recovery is also complete: an
unavailable browser capture source becomes
`recovery_required`, screen-act blocks before dispatch, Observer recommends the
existing prepare action, and a fresh bounded capture restores sidecar IPC
without restarting the helper. A bounded browser navigation/new-tab action is
now complete on the same trusted sidecar transport, with HTTP(S) URL validation,
lease/capture gates, sidecar IPC, browser mutation, refreshed capture, audit,
and an Observer control. Its core planner/task-executor bridge is also complete:
planner and executor use
one production action descriptor, task evidence retains the bounded sidecar
effect, and verification prefers the post-action capture URL over stale session
metadata. The next slice should make an in-flight browser task recover across a
capture-source interruption using the existing recovery loop. That bounded
action-level recovery is now complete: only sidecar capture reasons trigger one
prepare and one retry, and compact interruption/retry evidence is attached to
the task. Active-task continuity across session-manager restart is now complete:
authority dependency loss becomes a persisted recoverable task, explicit
session/sidecar restoration reuses the existing recovery route, and only
unfinished browser plan actions execute through the trusted sidecar. The next
continuity gap is startup reconciliation for a persisted active task after the
core process itself restarts. That exit gate is now complete: startup converts
only persisted running browser plans to recoverable evidence, preserves queued
and paused tasks, and the existing recovery path executes only unfinished work
through the still-running sidecar. The next Level 2 capability should establish
independently supervised user-session sidecar ownership with fail-closed
authority disconnect and explicit fresh-lease reconnect. Do not add horizontal
navigation variants, a readiness-only chain, fault-injection endpoints,
automatic action restart, root/system daemon ownership, or desktop-wide capture.

That independent sidecar slice is now complete. The current-user socket process
survives session-manager restart, clears binding/capture on disconnect, retains
no reconnect lease, and requires the existing approved action to bind a fresh
session. The milestone proves same-PID reconnect and stale-lease rejection. The
next Level 2 reliability gap is explicit replacement after the sidecar process
itself exits unexpectedly; it must reuse the existing lifecycle and must not
auto-start a replacement.

That replacement gap is now complete. Unexpected sidecar exit suspends action
authority, reports recovery without automatic replacement, and the existing
approved lifecycle starts a different PID before capture/actions resume. The
remaining Level 2 runtime-ownership step is a declarative, non-auto-started
`systemd --user` unit path for this same sidecar contract. Do not turn it into a
root service, login auto-start, or a second lifecycle API.

The unit contract is now materialized and evaluated through the existing Nix
body-config milestone: desktop-body defines a hardened
`openclaw-trusted-sidecar@` user unit with no `wantedBy` and `Restart=no`. This
does not yet change runtime ownership. The next real slice is to make the
existing approved lifecycle action launch/stop that fixed user-unit instance,
while retaining direct spawn only as an explicit development fallback and
keeping lease/session values out of the environment file.

That approved launcher bridge is now complete. The session-manager runtime
default uses the fixed `openclaw-trusted-sidecar@primary.service` user unit,
while development must explicitly select the direct-spawn fallback. The
existing lifecycle owns
the mode-0600 environment file, systemd start/stop, deterministic socket bind,
Observer launcher readback, and cleanup. Session, lease, credential, provider,
and browser-runtime URL values never enter the file. The real Phase 3 milestone
materializes the test unit, controls it through `systemctl --user`, proves
restart/replacement/action continuity, and removes both unit and environment
afterward.

This proves user-session ownership, not every Nix deployment topology. The
current Nix body skeleton still launches its main services as system services;
moving session-manager itself into a selected login-user manager, or adding a
separately governed cross-manager bridge, remains deferred. Do not hardcode a
desktop UID or add a root proxy merely to hide that deployment boundary.

The next real Level 2 behavior is bounded browser workspace continuity across a
browser-runtime restart. Preserve only compact AI-owned tab/active-URL/session
intent; restore it fail-closed without a lease or automatic action replay, and
reuse the existing prepare/rebind/recovery and Observer surfaces.

That workspace-continuity behavior is now complete. Browser runtime atomically
persists a bounded, mode-0600 navigation intent and restores tabs/session intent
without running state, PID, lease, input/click data, capture payload, or action
replay. Existing prepare supplies fresh authority, the sidecar reports recovery
status, and the real Phase 3 milestone proves eight tabs survive a process
restart before governed actions continue.

The next product gap is no longer continuity metadata. Browser runtime remains
a simulated in-memory browser with a synthetic PID. The next real Level 2 slice
should put a proven local browser engine behind the current bounded API and
sidecar contract, starting with one user-space profile, one governed HTTP(S)
navigation, and compact real-engine capture. Do not add a readiness endpoint or
broaden into desktop capture.

That real-engine slice is complete. Browser runtime can now launch a
NixOS-managed Firefox through `puppeteer-core`, expose its real PID/title/URL/tab
state, execute existing lease-gated page input/click/new-tab operations, feed
real page metadata through capture and screen-sense, and remove its ephemeral
AI profile on disconnect/shutdown. The targeted milestone uses a loopback page
and the production prepare/lease path; no hidden browser download, external
fixture, root launch, desktop capture, or `--no-sandbox` bypass is involved.

The Level 2 component-ownership gap is now closed. The Nix body partitions
enabled components into exclusive system or login-user ownership, and the
desktop profile places session-manager and browser-runtime in
`systemd.user.services` alongside the sidecar contract. They follow the
graphical session, use per-user state/profile paths, preserve same-scope
ordering, and default to the fixed NixOS Firefox package. Nix evaluation proves
neither component is duplicated in the system manager; no UID, root proxy, or
browser sandbox bypass is used.

The next real Level 2 gap is bounded visual capture of the AI-owned browser
page. The real adapter currently supplies process/page/tab metadata, while the
capture response's readable blocks are still derived from runtime state rather
than a browser pixel frame. Extend the existing capture/trust/Observer lane with
strictly bounded frame acquisition and freshness evidence. Do not capture the
desktop, write arbitrary image paths, add a parallel route, or create another
readiness shell.

That visual-capture gap is now closed through the existing route. Firefox
captures only its active AI-owned page as a fixed `960x540` bounded JPEG;
shared validation enforces dimensions, a 256 KiB ceiling, digest, freshness,
page scope, no desktop capture, and no persistence. Observer receives the
validated data URL, while sidecar polling, task/read-model summaries, and audit
events retain metadata only. The real milestone verifies actual JPEG bytes and
proves persisted events contain no image data.

The next smallest Level 2 behavior is to ground trusted browser actions in that
visual evidence: sidecar metadata capture should produce a fresh frame digest
and sequence before dispatch, action evidence should link that compact
provenance, and post-action capture should advance it. Keep image bytes out of
sidecar state, task evidence, and logs; do not add another endpoint or readiness
wrapper.

That grounding behavior is now complete. Real-engine sidecar observations
carry only fresh frame digest/sequence metadata; trusted actions bind compact
pre/post frame references, force post-mutation refresh, survive concurrent
capture invalidation, and propagate through screen-act plus autonomous task
evidence without image data. Simulated mode remains an explicit non-grounded
fallback. The real milestone proves both operator and autonomous navigation
change the observed frame and URL.

The next smallest Level 2 capability is a bounded read-only semantic target
inventory for the active AI-owned page, linked to the current visual frame.
Expose only visible interactive role/name/bounds metadata with hard limits and
no form values or mutation through the existing capture/screen/Observer lane.
Do not jump directly to arbitrary selectors, page-script execution, or another
readiness endpoint.

That inventory is now complete. The real Firefox path exposes at most 64
visible interactive targets with bounded names and viewport-clamped bounds,
ties target ids plus an inventory digest to the current visual frame, and keeps
values, selectors, arbitrary page script, mutation, desktop capture, and
persistence absent. Full items remain in current browser/screen/Observer
readback; sidecar, task, summary, metadata, and audit paths retain only compact
inventory evidence. The existing capture and Phase 3 milestones prove the real
fixture behavior and unchanged lease/recovery controls.

The next smallest Level 2 capability is governed semantic target action through
the existing trusted action lane. Resolve only a frame-scoped `targetId`, bind
the request to the matching frame and inventory digest, reject stale evidence,
and prove the post-action frame. Do not accept CSS/XPath selectors or arbitrary
page scripts, and do not add a parallel endpoint or readiness chain.

That first governed action is now complete for semantic click. The existing
mouse-click route accepts a normalized click-only target reference, resolves it
against the current browser-owned inventory, derives coordinates internally,
and rejects stale frame/inventory evidence. Sidecar mediation retains compact
semantic effect plus pre/post visual grounding, and Observer shows the result.
The real Firefox milestone proves navigation by target id and fail-closed reuse
of the old reference; Phase 3 recovery and takeover checks remain unchanged.

The next smallest Level 2 capability is autonomous semantic target selection
inside core after its initial screen observation. Build the current reference
at dispatch time and reuse the existing mouse-click/task evidence path. Do not
add another endpoint, selector surface, or action family. Semantic typing stays
deferred until input content no longer appears in public browser state or audit
events.

That autonomous selection is now complete. `browser.semantic_click` stores
bounded exact-name/optional-role intent, core materializes one unique current
target after initial observation, and capture recovery rematerializes after its
single prepare retry. Before dispatch, sidecar refreshes capture and requires
the target reference, inventory digest, and visual-grounding frame to match.
The real Firefox milestone proves autonomous selection, click, task evidence,
post-frame advance, and expected navigation.

The next smallest Level 2 capability is write-only semantic text input. Remove
legacy plaintext input echoes from browser state, summaries, action/task
evidence, and audit events first; retain only bounded length/redaction
evidence. Then reuse the same current-target selection, sidecar refresh, lease,
visual grounding, and Observer path for one semantic type operation without
persisting or reading back the value.

The plaintext-removal prerequisite is now complete. Inputs are bounded to 2,000
characters and all browser/screen/Observer/event/task/recovery/persistence
readbacks retain only count/truncation and negative exposure evidence. Core
state persistence strips action text; an active task restored without its
transient value becomes `input_reentry_required` and cannot replay. Existing
core, Observer, recovery, and real Firefox milestones prove the new contract.

The next smallest Level 2 capability is frame-bound semantic type through the
existing keyboard route. Select one current enabled textbox after observation,
carry text only in the execution request, revalidate the same inventory/frame
at sidecar and browser-runtime, and return write-only input evidence with
pre/post visual grounding. Do not add selectors, a parallel route, text
persistence, or readback of the typed value.

That semantic type capability is now complete. Core selects the current
textbox after observation, the transient execution value never enters the
plan, sidecar and browser-runtime validate the same frame-bound authority, and
the existing keyboard route returns only semantic effect, input evidence, and
pre/post visual grounding. Real Firefox, Observer, persistence, recovery, and
Phase 3 checks pass. The current bounded Level 2 browser eye-hand exit gate is
closed; do not grow more horizontal action variants.

The next active route is the kernel evolution whitepaper's Phase A Nix purity
gap. Start with one real cohesive service closure packaged into `/nix/store`
and make its generated unit execute from that read-only derivation instead of
mutable `/opt/openclaw`. Preserve user-session ownership, runtime state/log
paths, public routes, and real milestones. Do not introduce root hostd, D-Bus,
eBPF, or broad all-service migration until this first packaging proof works.

That first packaging proof is now complete for event-hub. Its minimal closure
contains only four runtime files, the generated unit executes from a read-only
store WorkingDirectory, and the body-config milestone starts the store process
and proves health plus audit event write/read against a separate state path.
The other eight services remain explicitly mutable-repo backed.

The next Phase A slice is the second concrete closure, screen-sense. Package its
exact shared-events/shared-utils imports, preserve system ownership and upstream
contracts, evaluate the unit, and prove a real screen readback from the store
path. Only then consider a small packaging helper based on demonstrated
duplication.

That second closure is now complete. Screen-sense contains exactly 10 runtime
files, its generated system unit points into the store, and a real packaged
process produces browser-backed `/screen/current` readback against bounded
loopback upstreams. With two matching derivations, the common fileset install
mechanism now lives in a small helper while both service runtime manifests stay
explicit. Phase A is 2/9 services at this checkpoint, not complete.

The next closure is screen-act. Preserve its current ownership and upstream
URLs, include only its mediation module plus exact shared imports, and prove one
real lease-mediated action from the store path without exposing input payloads.

That third closure is now complete. Screen-act contains exactly 11 runtime
files, its generated system unit points into the store, and a real packaged
process performs a trusted lease-mediated browser input action against bounded
loopback upstreams. Only write-only input evidence is retained; plaintext does
not enter the response or action state. Phase A is 3/9 services, not complete.

The next closure is system-heal. Preserve its system ownership, event-hub and
system-sense URLs, and writable state path while proving representative
persisted diagnosis or simulated maintenance behavior from the read-only store
source. Defer the broader system-sense closure to its own explicit slice.

That fourth closure is now complete. System-heal contains exactly seven runtime
files, its generated system unit points into the store, and a real packaged
process persists a conservative simulated diagnosis to a separate writable
state file and restores it after process restart. No real repair executes.
Phase A is 4/9 services, not complete.

The next closure is system-sense. Its larger explicit runtime manifest must
cover the current body, health, file, command, and systemd modules while the
representative packaging proof remains read-only and non-privileged.

That fifth closure is now complete. System-sense contains exactly 19 runtime
files, its generated system unit points into the store, and a real packaged
process returns Linux body/resource state after sampling seven bounded loopback
service targets. The proof invokes no command, file-write, systemd, or repair
route and performs no host mutation. Phase A is 5/9 services, not complete.

The next closure is session-manager. Preserve login-user ownership, writable
recovery state, and trusted sidecar lifecycle contracts while proving session
state behavior without starting an unapproved helper process.

That sixth closure is now complete. Session-manager contains exactly 14 runtime
files, its generated login-user unit points into the store and keeps recovery
intent under `%S/openclaw`, and a real packaged process creates an authoritative
Level 2 session while remaining fail-closed at `awaiting_browser`. No external
sidecar or recovery intent is started automatically. Phase A is 6/9 services,
not complete.

The next closure is observer-ui. Package its runtime client composition and
served assets without npm runtime dependencies, preserve upstream contracts,
and prove real HTML/client responses from the store.

That seventh closure is now complete. Observer-ui contains exactly 49 runtime
files, its generated system unit points into the store, and a real packaged
process serves the complete HTML/client composition with engineering-loop DOM
evidence. The shared source-closure helper now supports reviewed app roots
without copying whole source directories. Phase A is 7/9 services, not complete.

The next closure is browser-runtime. Its Puppeteer dependencies must be a
reproducible Nix closure with downloads disabled, while login-user ownership,
the Nix-managed Firefox executable, and real browser behavior remain intact.

That eighth closure is now complete. Browser-runtime has a lockfile-pinned
production Puppeteer closure beside 13 explicit runtime source files, its
generated login-user unit points into the store, and a real packaged process
proves bounded open plus fail-closed workspace restoration. The heavyweight
real Firefox launch remains in its dedicated browser/release gate rather than
the normal package iteration loop. Phase A is 8/9 services, not complete.

The final Phase A closure is core. Package its 134 runtime modules and exact
shared imports without tests/artifacts, preserve writable control-plane state,
and prove representative persisted behavior from the store.

That final closure is now complete. Core contains exactly 149 runtime files,
its generated system unit points into the store, and a real packaged process
persists and restores an unexecuted queued task. The trusted sidecar template
also runs from the session-manager store closure. Phase A is complete at 9/9
services with no default desktop-body process WorkingDirectory under
`/opt/openclaw`.

The active route now advances to kernel-whitepaper Phase B through
`docs/plans/OPENCLAW_DBUS_NATIVE_SYSTEMD_CONTROL_PLAN.md`. Start with native
read-only systemd unit inventory behind the existing system-sense/Observer
contract. Do not add privileged mutation, hostd, Polkit, or a readiness shell.

That first Phase B slice is now complete. System-sense reads the nine fixed
OpenClaw unit records through native systemd D-Bus from its lockfile-pinned Nix
store closure, exposes only an eight-property inventory allowlist, and reports
the transport through the existing route and Observer panel. VM milestones
prove a real `loaded/active/running` core unit and no command evidence. The
temporary read-only `systemctl` fallback has been removed; bus failure is
fail-closed. This first inventory slice intentionally excluded privileged
mutation; the separately governed fixed hostd restart is recorded below.

The second fixed Phase B slice is now proven in the switched VM generation. Its
owner-separation follow-up makes desktop system services run under
`openclaw-service`, gives the fixed store-native hostd its independent
`openclaw-hostd` service account and Polkit subject, and keeps core submission
on the shared `openclaw` socket group. The new core and Observer real-execution
checks both completed through that account combination. The response keeps the
kernel-level peer credential verification explicit: hostd now passes each
accepted socket FD to a fixed Nix-native `SO_PEERCRED` helper, matches only
`openclaw-service` with the `openclaw` group, and rejects the fixed mutation
before the D-Bus handler on mismatch or unavailable verification.
Core reaches hostd only through its bounded Unix socket, reuses the existing
approved next-repair lifecycle, and has no direct systemctl/sudo fallback. The
switched generation removed the historical host sudo helper. Core and Observer
real-execution milestones prove exit zero, D-Bus job paths, changed PIDs,
restored health, and no password prompt.
Post-verification now derives restored health from the selected unit's native
inventory state and helper PID evidence; failures recommend operator-reviewed
declarative-generation recovery and never issue an automatic second restart.
It uses a bounded read-only readiness poll because systemd process readiness can
precede the restarted service's HTTP-listener readiness. Hostd rejects unknown
fields, arbitrary units/methods, and response evidence whose request id is not
bound to the originating core request; core also requires the compact matching
peer-identity evidence. Broader systemd mutation remains deferred.

The Level 1 live-plugin-refresh migration now owns a real fixed-registry
generation lifecycle. An approved existing refresh task builds and validates a
new built-in registry generation, atomically swaps the shared native plugin
plan owner, retains the previous generation, and causes later capability plans
to report the active generation id, sequence, and hash. Compact active and
previous generation metadata now persists in core runtime state and is
rehydrated after a core restart only when its hash matches the current fixed
registry. It still performs no arbitrary module discovery/import, plugin code
execution, loader-cache invalidation, provider egress, or automatic rollback.
Do not expand this into another readiness chain.

The existing operator stop control now also closes the trusted work-view action
authority before marking a session-bound task failed. It reuses the existing
session-manager suspend route, records only compact revoked-state evidence on
the task, and fails closed if the authority cannot be confirmed revoked. Tasks
without a trusted work-view session keep the existing local stop behavior. This
closes an operator-visible stop boundary without adding a route, sidecar,
automatic restart, or new permission surface.
Observer task history now renders the compact revoked/authority state from that
outcome so the stop result is visible after refresh as well as in the API
response.
All operator authority transitions now include the task's bound work-view
session id when one exists. Session-manager rejects stale-session suspend or
resume requests before mutating the current lease, keeping the current session
active and non-degraded on that mismatch.
When an attached task is stopped successfully, its outcome also carries the
existing compact work-view recovery evidence with an `operator_stop` stage and
the recommendation to restore/rebind the trusted work view before recovery.
The recovery task receives that provenance without the session lease id and
does not restart or replay the task automatically; the existing Observer task
history path renders the same recovery recommendation after refresh.

## Completed Phase C Slice

The first bounded kernel-whitepaper eBPF process-execution observation is
complete and documented in
`docs/plans/OPENCLAW_PHASE_C_KERNEL_PROCESS_EXEC_PLAN.md`. Store-native
system-sense attaches only the raw `sched_process_exec` tracepoint through a
libbpf ring buffer and returns raw `timestampNs`, `pid`, `uid`, and `comm`
fields plus a separate bounded executable-identity readback; raw attachment
avoids granting the service broad tracefs read access.
The capability is opt-in in the Nix body module; the desktop profile grants
only `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON` plus the required `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity`
resource limit to the non-root system-sense service when it is enabled. The
existing core system-sense proxy and Observer expose the bounded read model and
explicit permission/unavailable states.

This slice deliberately does not capture command lines, paths, file content,
environment, or network traffic; it does not persist events, enforce policy,
block processes, mutate the host, expand hostd, or start declarative Nix
self-evolution.

The first concrete operator gap is now closed on the same route: each bounded
capture also returns a deterministic in-memory readback summary with unique
comm/PID/UID counts, a fixed 16-entry command-count bound, timestamp endpoints,
capture window, event limit, and explicit non-persistence. Observer renders the
summary alongside the raw four-field events. This is not an event ledger and it
does not survive restart. Select the next eBPF-adjacent capability from a
specific operator need exposed by this readback before adding another event
class.

The continuity refinement is also complete on the same route. Successful
captures receive a sequence and activity state plus a bounded list of newly
seen comm names; disabled, busy, and failed captures report continuity as
unavailable without changing the last successful baseline. This remains
in-memory only and is not a process event ledger. Continue from an explicit
operator need shown by this continuity evidence before adding another event
class.

The final concrete operator gap in this slice was executable identity ambiguity. A `comm` value
can be truncated or shared by unrelated binaries, so the same raw capture now
derives a separate `openclaw-kernel-process-exec-executable-identity-v0`
readback. The raw tracepoint uses CO-RE to read only
`linux_binprm.filename`, limits each filename to 255 bytes, returns at most 16
identity entries, and keeps the values in the current response only. The
existing four-field raw event contract remains unchanged. No `/proc` lookup,
command-line, environment, arbitrary VFS path, file-content, network, policy,
or persistence capability is introduced.

Phase C is now closed for this operator loop. The switched core and Observer
milestones pass, full `body-config` passes, and the running system-sense service
returns the bounded executable identity readback. Do not add another eBPF event
kind or a second readiness chain without a new operator need demonstrated by
the current capture evidence. The next capability must be selected from a
concrete user-visible gap and must preserve the existing local-first,
non-persistent, policy-deferred boundary.

The first demonstrated Level 2 work-view gap is now closed through the
existing Engineering Context Packet action. An explicit `includeWorkView`
request reads session-manager's authoritative `/work-view/state` and returns
`openclaw-native-engineering-work-view-association-v0` with compact task
binding, helper authority, and recovery status. It does not expose lease ids,
active URLs, capture payloads, automatic binding, action dispatch, provider
content, or external egress. Observer renders the association beside the
packet, and unavailable session-manager state fails closed without inventing a
binding.

The resulting unbound-task workflow is now closed by one explicit
operator-reviewed bind action at
`/plugins/native-adapter/engineering-context/work-view/bind`. It re-reads
authoritative session-manager state, preserves the task status, rejects stale
session/work-view identity, and does not dispatch work. The existing context
packet milestone proves the real local route and Observer control. Do not
infer another browser action variant or create another Level 1
readiness/evidence-only shell from historical plan text; preserve the existing
provider, root, desktop-wide capture, and arbitrary endpoint execution
boundaries.

The next concrete operator gap was the recovery decision shown by that same
readback: a divergent or inactive trusted helper recommends the existing
`prepare_work_view` action, but the context packet panel previously exposed only
status. The panel now renders that recovery action and, only for the exact
allowlisted recommendation, bridges to the existing reviewed Prepare Work View
control before rebuilding the packet. A follow-up readback after preparation
can recommend `reveal_work_view` because the AI work view is prepared but
hidden; the same panel now exposes a contextual Reveal Trusted Work View
control through the existing action runner. Both controls revalidate current
state, do not rebind tasks or replay actions, and do not create a new endpoint
or automatic recovery path. If a selected task retains an old session binding
after that recovery, the same packet Bind control now becomes an explicit
`Rebind Task to Work View` action; it requires `confirm:true` plus
`rebind:true`, revalidates fresh authority, preserves task execution state, and
does not replay the task. The same packet can now explicitly request the bounded
work-view observation bridge, which reports capture freshness, frame
provenance, and semantic-target counts without transferring page URLs, pixels,
page text, target items, input values, or selectors. Use that metadata to close
a demonstrated operator decision before adding another Level 2 action.
The packet can likewise request the existing bounded plan/todo workbench
summary and guidance-only next action; that context remains read-only and does
not create or execute a task.

## Identity-Upgrade Alignment

Every new capability must state which identity level it serves:

```text
Level 1: user-space control plane
Level 2: trusted session/work-view component
Level 3: controlled system-level body daemon
Level 4: graphics-stack-native AI workspace
```

The enhanced `openclaw` migration currently belongs mostly to Level 1. Some
future work-view manager and session helper work belongs to Level 2. Host repair
and controlled privileged actions belong to Level 3. Nested compositor and AI
session work belongs to Level 4.

Do not jump identity levels to make a milestone pass.

## Phase Plan Cleanup Policy

Historical phase plan files under `docs/plans/OPENCLAW_PHASE_*_PLAN.md` are not
the active roadmap. Many are still referenced by milestone checks and must remain
in place until the checks are refactored.

Use them as:

```text
evidence
test fixtures
historical implementation records
```

Do not use them as:

```text
automatic next-phase instructions
the current product roadmap
permission to continue nested safety shells
```

The active routing documents are listed in `docs/README.md` and
`docs/plans/README.md`.

## Definition Of Real Progress

A development slice counts as real progress only if it answers:

```text
What user-visible or operator-visible capability became more real?
Which whitepaper or identity-upgrade goal does it serve?
What evidence proves it?
What remains deliberately deferred?
What is the next smallest real capability step?
```

If a slice cannot answer those questions, it is likely a checklist shell and
should be stopped or merged into a more meaningful slice.

## VM Agent Startup Checklist

Use this exact startup order on the VM:

```bash
cd /home/edvulcan/OpenClaw_On_NixOS
git pull origin main
git status --short
git log -10 --oneline
sed -n '1,260p' docs/OPENCLAW_FORWARD_WORK_DIRECTIVE.md
sed -n '1,220p' docs/README.md
sed -n '1,260p' docs/plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_MIGRATION_BRIEF.md
sed -n '1,260p' docs/architecture/OPENCLAW_SYSTEM_IDENTITY_UPGRADE_PATH.md
```

Then report:

```text
1. Did the VM clone and checkout the preserved source reference?
2. Does the checked-out commit match `d90b253b0c03191613e45c36b1434078b8788bed`?
3. Which enhanced capabilities are already absorbed?
4. Which enhanced capabilities require migration?
5. Which active trunk is selected next, and why is it real capability progress
   instead of another safety wrapper?
```
