# NixSoma Fixed-Unit Incident Scheduler Plan

Updated: 2026-07-19

## Purpose

Give the Level 3 body a bounded background owner for routine local observation.
The operator should not approve every read-only health check, while provider,
repair, activation, and rollback boundaries remain explicitly governed.

## Delivered Flow

```text
Core starts with an explicitly configured interval
-> read /system/health and /system/systemd/units without mutation
-> inspect only the three shared hostd fixed targets
-> compute a compact failure fingerprint per unit
-> audit a new unhealthy fingerprint before durable mutation
-> create one completed local incident task
-> show the compact task through existing Observer history/detail
-> suppress the same fingerprint until recovery or a changed failure
-> automatically create or reuse local triage for every current incident
-> bind source task, fingerprint, fixed unit, and existing repair draft owner
-> create one completed local plan/evidence task without approval or execution
-> automatically promote current triage through the existing repair owner
-> revalidate the entire source chain against current scheduler state
-> create one existing fixed-target real repair task and pending approval
-> let the operator explicitly approve or deny that exact task
-> after approval, revalidate source, promotion, task, target, and approval
-> audit and reserve one automatic dispatch without recovery/retry
-> execute once through the existing fixed-target Executor and hostd boundary
-> retain the existing incident receipt and post-repair health evidence
-> on Core restart, reconcile terminal reservation state
-> fail any non-terminal reserved dispatch closed without replay
```

The NixOS module enables the scheduler by default at a five-minute interval.
The runtime clamps configuration to 30 seconds through 24 hours, delays its
first tick until one interval after startup, prevents overlapping reads, and
clears its timer during Core shutdown.

## Persistence And Dedupe

Core persists the last tick, next due time, compact read-failure code, and the
current status, fingerprint, latest observation time, latest incident, triage,
repair task and approval IDs, and compact triage/promotion outcomes for each
fixed unit. Unknown persisted units are discarded. Recovery clears the active
fingerprint and derived workflow state, so a later regression creates a new
incident; a Core restart does not duplicate an unchanged incident. Transient
triage or promotion failure retains only a fixed error code and is retried on
the next unchanged unhealthy tick. Approved dispatch persists a compact
reservation and terminal outcome; it never retains Executor error text. Core
startup never replays a reserved dispatch: terminal tasks align state, while
missing or non-terminal work receives one compact interrupted code and is
failed closed.

## Authority Boundary

- The fixed targets are derived from the shared hostd restart capability
  registry; callers cannot provide a unit.
- Observation reads local System Sense endpoints only.
- Incident tasks are terminal evidence and never enter the execution queue.
- Audit failure creates no incident task or dedupe mutation.
- Read failure records only `system_sense_read_failed`; raw error text is not
  persisted.
- Evidence excludes URLs, journal messages, provider output, credentials,
  commands, hostd receipts, and private paths.
- The scheduler cannot call a provider, create provider approval, invoke hostd,
  execute repair, activate a generation, or roll one back.
- Automatic and operator-requested triage share one owner. It revalidates the
  source fingerprint against current scheduler state, coalesces concurrent
  requests, and reuses a completed triage for the same source evidence.
- Triage calls only the existing read-only repair draft owner. It does not add
  capability or command steps, supersede active tasks, create approval, or
  enter the execution queue.
- Automatic and operator-requested repair promotion share one audit-first,
  restart-safe owner and remain idempotent for one triage binding. They ignore
  caller target, execution, and approval fields.
- Promotion reuses the existing hostd fixed-target repair task owner with its
  real-execution shape, but returns while its approval is still pending. It
  neither approves the task nor invokes Operator, hostd, activation, rollback,
  or a provider.
- Approval resolution invokes the dispatch coordinator only for a
  scheduler-triggered automatic promotion. Generic and manually promoted tasks
  are ignored.
- The coordinator revalidates the current incident, triage and promotion hashes,
  exact approval/task binding, fixed hostd capability, and real-execution shape,
  then requires a successful audit before persisting one dispatch reservation.
- The systemd Executor requires that reservation for automatic promotions, so
  a stale, audit-blocked, failed, or directly invoked task cannot bypass the
  coordinator. Execution uses no automatic recovery or retry.
- Startup reconciliation performs no observation, Executor call, hostd call,
  or retry. A non-terminal reservation becomes explicit failed recovery
  evidence and requires a newly observed incident/task chain.

## Evidence

- healthy, first-failure, duplicate, recovery/regression, single-flight,
  audit-failure, read-failure, timer-stop, fixed-target, restart, and local
  triage binding, concurrent promotion, stale-source, and audit-failure tests;
- real task-manager extension serialization and Core-state restoration tests;
- generated Observer client syntax, compact task-detail assertions, and the
  explicit Triage action;
- `884/884` workspace tests and full typecheck;
- 811-entry milestone registry, script audit, and 160-character Windows path
  budget;
- full `dev-body-config-check.sh`, including exact 222-file Core and 77-file
  Observer Nix closures.

The completed automatic triage, promotion, approved one-shot dispatch, and
startup fail-closed source is deployed on the physical host as
`/nix/store/yzjwwp67apgv4rrzpm3g2gz12bqkq7vj-nixos-system-nixos-26.05.4808.569d57850992`.
The closure diff from the preceding generation contained only `openclaw-core`,
and the switch restarted only that service. Post-deployment probes proved all
eight system and both user services active with `NRestarts=0`, seven health
responses at HTTP 200, anonymous task/approval/triage/repair rejection at HTTP
401, the exact live Core store closure, both Observer incident controls, and a
healthy post-switch scheduler tick with unchanged task and approval counts. No
provider request, repair execution, hostd mutation, rollback, or reboot was
used.

## Deferred

- automatic provider diagnosis;
- automatic approval resolution;
- arbitrary systemd targets;
- real activation and rollback validation in a disposable mutation environment.

## Next Real Capability

Freeze the completed fixed-unit incident lane. Select the next distinct
operator-visible capability from the identity route and kernel whitepaper; do
not add another incident readiness, dispatch, retry, or evidence wrapper.
