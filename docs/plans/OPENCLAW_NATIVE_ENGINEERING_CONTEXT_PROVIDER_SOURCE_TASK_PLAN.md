# OpenClaw Native Engineering Context Provider Source Task Plan

Updated: 2026-07-15

## Active Slice

Explicit source-task selection for the existing approved provider context
handoff.

Identity alignment: Level 1 engineering control plane at the Level 1 to Level 2
work-view/provider boundary.

## Demonstrated Gap

The provider egress executor owns the live provider task, but the context packet
was also forced to use that same task id. A provider task therefore could not
consume the preceding source-command, verification, edit, or workbench task
that contained the engineering evidence the operator intended to review.

## Implemented Behavior

The existing context request keeps `taskId` for the provider egress task and
may explicitly add:

```json
{
  "taskId": "<approved-egress-task-id>",
  "sourceTaskId": "<existing-engineering-evidence-task-id>"
}
```

Materialization then:

```text
keeps the egress task as the execution and approval owner
requires the source task to exist in the local task map
builds transcript, verification, recovery, work-view, and plan/todo evidence
from the selected source task
records executionTaskId and sourceTaskId in compact handoff evidence
rechecks the complete materialized provider request through the existing hash
binding before credential read or network egress
```

When `sourceTaskId` is absent, the existing same-task behavior remains the
default. A missing source task fails closed. The source task is read-only in
this path; it is not rebound, resumed, mutated, or automatically executed.

## Governance

```text
explicit sourceTaskId required for cross-task context
provider egress approval remains attached to the egress task
source task identity and request content are covered by the binding
context content remains transient
no automatic task/approval/action creation
no provider call during materialization
no credential-store read during context assembly
```

The source task id is bounded metadata. Its task goal, command output, plan,
and recovery content remain subject to the existing output bounds,
credential-like redaction, microcompact protection, and provider message size
limit.

## Evidence

Runtime:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-live-provider-runtime-context-packet.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-live-provider-runtime-live-execution.mjs
```

Tests:

```text
services/openclaw-core/test/cloud-live-provider-runtime-context-packet.test.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/cloud-live-provider-runtime-live-execution.test.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/task-executor.test.mjs
```

The production-shape materializer test proves a provider task consumes a
separate source task, preserves both ids, includes the source transcript, and
rejects an unknown source. Existing live execution tests prove only compact
source/egress provenance is retained.

## Deferred

```text
automatic source-task selection
automatic provider task creation or approval
automatic source-task mutation or recovery
provider transcript persistence
raw visual/page payload transfer
ACPX/Codex live process execution and long-lived LSP pools
```

## Next Smallest Capability

Keep source selection explicit. Only add an Observer source-task picker if a
concrete operator workflow demonstrates that manually supplying the existing
task id is the remaining usability gap.
