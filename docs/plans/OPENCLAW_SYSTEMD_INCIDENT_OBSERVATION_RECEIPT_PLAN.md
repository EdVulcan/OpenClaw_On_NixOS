# NixSoma Systemd Incident Observation Receipt Plan

Updated: 2026-07-18

## Purpose

Persist one compact, hash-bound local record after an operator selects the
reviewed same-unit observation refresh. This turns transient health, unit, and
journal panel reads into bounded evidence that a later governed diagnosis can
reference without retaining journal messages or provider output.

## Delivered Flow

```text
reviewed refresh_systemd_incident_observation recommendation
-> revalidate provider task, source incident receipt, fixed unit, and hashes
-> read body health, fixed-unit inventory, and 25-line journal evidence
-> publish compact audit evidence before task mutation
-> persist one observation receipt on the provider task
-> render receipt hash, unit, health booleans, journal counts, and boundaries
```

The existing Observer action invokes
`act.openclaw.systemd_incident.observation_receipt` before refreshing the
three existing panels. If recording fails, panel refresh does not start.

## Receipt Contract

The `openclaw-systemd-incident-observation-receipt-v0` record contains only:

- provider task, source incident task, and source receipt bindings;
- fixed systemd unit and health-service key;
- observation timestamp and deterministic receipt hash;
- service and unit availability/health booleans;
- bounded journal availability, requested/returned counts, and parse errors;
- explicit negative authority and exposure flags.

It excludes journal messages, URLs, commands, credentials, provider response
content, hostd receipts, and repair authority.

## Authority Boundary

- Explicit operator selection remains required for the reviewed action.
- The capability creates no task or approval and performs no provider egress.
- It reads only the three existing system-sense observation owners.
- The target cannot be supplied independently of the bound incident receipt.
- Compact audit publication must succeed before task state is changed.
- It does not execute a command, invoke hostd, retry repair, activate a
  generation, or authorize rollback.

## Evidence

- focused builder tests for compact persistence, binding rejection, and
  audit-before-mutation failure;
- production `createCapabilityRuntime` invoke assembly and summary coverage;
- Observer exact request and failure-before-refresh regressions;
- generated client syntax and task-detail readback assertions;
- Nix Core closure membership and exact file-count validation.

## Delivered Follow-up

The fresh exact-bound diagnosis task is complete in
`OPENCLAW_SYSTEMD_OBSERVATION_AI_HANDOFF_PLAN.md`. It binds the observation
receipt hash, source incident hash, unit, model, endpoint fingerprint, and
request/context hash while retaining explicit approval before egress and no
repair authority.
