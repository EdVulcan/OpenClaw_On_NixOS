# OpenClaw Native Engineering Loop Work Standards Bridge Plan

Updated: 2026-07-10

## Active Slice

Engineering Loop State work standards bridge.

This slice connects the existing prompt-derived work standards assessment to
the existing Observer Engineering Loop State panel. It does not add a backend
route, new milestone lane, task creation path, approval path, command
execution, or mutation.

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Implemented Behavior

When Engineering Loop State has an active task, the Observer now reads:

```text
GET /plugins/native-adapter/prompt-semantics?query=edit&limit=24
```

and appends `openclaw-engineering-work-standards-v0` status to the same state
readback:

```text
standards registry
status
satisfied / required score
missing required standards
operator contract flags
prompt-wall boundary
```

This keeps standards visible where the operator is already deciding the next
engineering action.

## Governance

The bridge remains UI/readback-only:

```text
no task creation
no approval creation
no operator step
no mutation
no prompt execution
no provider call
```

The standards bridge guides the existing loop; it does not replace policy,
approval, ledgers, verification evidence, or recovery evidence.

## Evidence

Observer runtime:

```text
apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-runtime-engineering-loop-controls.mjs
```

Validation target:

```text
openclaw-native-engineering-loop-operator-controls
```

The existing operator-controls milestone checks that the served client contains
the standards bridge functions, route, registry token, and no-mutation boundary.

## Deferred

The following remain deferred:

```text
automatic task approval based on standards
automatic execution based on standards
automatic recovery rerun
server-side policy enforcement from prompt standards
provider/network egress
root/system daemon work
```

## Next Slice

The next useful safe slice should turn standards visibility into a small
server-side read-only task coverage assessment only if it can reuse existing
task, verification, ledger, and recovery evidence without opening another
readiness chain.
