# Phase C Kernel Process-Exec Capture Plan

Status: implementation, switched-VM acceptance, full body-config, bounded
readback, continuity, and executable identity proof passed, 2026-07-14

## Purpose

Advance the kernel evolution whitepaper from the completed Nix-store and fixed
native D-Bus foundations to one real, read-only eBPF body nerve. The selected
capability is bounded `sched_process_exec` observation owned by system-sense.

This is a capability slice, not a general kernel event bus. A successful raw
event returns only `timestampNs`, `pid`, `uid`, and `comm` through a libbpf ring
buffer. The same response may expose a separate bounded executable-identity
readback derived from the exec filename; it is not part of the raw event
contract. The user-space route validates both contracts and exposes the
bounded read model through the existing core system-sense proxy and Observer.

## Identity Alignment

- Whitepaper level: Phase C, first eBPF kernel nerve.
- Runtime owner: store-native `openclaw-system-sense`.
- User-visible result: an operator can inspect recent process-exec events and
  distinguish disabled, captured, busy, unavailable, permission-denied, and
  invalid-output states.
- Authority: desktop-body configuration explicitly enables the capability and
  grants only `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_PERFMON` to the system-sense service.
- Runtime prerequisite: the system-sense unit sets `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity` so
  libbpf can establish its bounded ring-buffer probe without widening the
  capability set.

## Implementation Contract

- BPF attachment: raw `sched_process_exec` tracepoint, avoiding a tracefs
  event-ID read permission for the non-root service.
- Transport: libbpf ring buffer.
- Capture bounds: one fixed configuration window of at most 5 seconds and at
  most 4096 events; desktop defaults are 1000ms and 128 events.
- Raw output fields: `timestampNs`, `pid`, `uid`, `comm` only.
- Executable identity: CO-RE reads `linux_binprm.filename`, accepts at most
  255 bytes per value, and exposes at most 16 entries in the readback. This is
  the exec filename only, not arbitrary VFS path capture.
- Runtime behavior: one capture at a time, no automatic retry, no persistence,
  no policy execution, and no host mutation.
- Readback: the existing response includes a bounded in-memory summary with a
  fixed 16-entry comm count list, unique comm/PID/UID counts, event timestamp
  endpoints, capture window, event limit, and an explicit persisted: false
  marker.
- Executable identity readback: the existing response includes the fixed
  `openclaw-kernel-process-exec-executable-identity-v0` registry with a 16-entry
  bound and explicit persisted: false marker. The raw four-field event list is
  unchanged.
- Continuity: successful captures also carry an in-memory sequence, quiet or
  observed activity state, and at most 16 newly seen comm names from a tracked
  set of 64; disabled, busy, and failed captures do not advance the baseline.
- Failure behavior: permission and execution failures become explicit bounded
  status values without exposing raw stderr, command paths, argv, or file
  content.

## Evidence

- `services/openclaw-system-sense/test/kernel-process-exec-capture.test.mjs`
  proves disabled behavior, bounds, field validation, permission redaction,
  and concurrent-request serialization.
- `services/openclaw-system-sense/test/system-kernel-event-routes.test.mjs`
  proves the read-only route dispatch contract.
- `services/openclaw-core/test/route-handlers.test.mjs` proves the production
  core proxy forwards the route to system-sense.
- `openclaw-kernel-process-exec-capture` and its Observer pair are the
  switched-VM acceptance checks for the explicit Nix probe path, capabilities,
  and validation child process observed through the core proxy.
- `dev-body-config-check.sh` is the acceptance check for the probe derivation,
  system-sense source closure, desktop service environment, and capability
  bounding set. On a NixOS host it reuses the installed system channel as the
  flake nixpkgs input, with `OPENCLAW_BODY_CONFIG_NIXPKGS_OVERRIDE` available
  for an explicit source and the locked flake input as the fallback.

Local implementation, Nix evaluation/parse, shell validation, system-sense
tests (49/49), core route tests (32/32), and Observer served-source assembly
checks (3/3) pass. The updated derivation compiles the CO-RE raw tracepoint
probe. The current switched generation loaded the probe with only `CAP_BPF`,
`CAP_PERFMON`, and `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity`; the full body-config check passed
with the same boundary. The current core and Observer acceptance checks each
captured 18 events and observed `/run/current-system/sw/bin/true` through the
executable identity readback.

The bounded readback evidence includes deterministic summary ordering, identity
counts, and the fixed command summary bound in the system-sense tests. Observer
tests prove the served panel, DOM bindings, and refresh wiring expose the same
summary. The switched-VM Observer acceptance also checks the readback registry,
non-persistence marker, and the validation process name.

The continuity evidence proves first-capture and continued-capture sequencing,
new comm detection, and non-advancing unavailable/busy states. It retains no
event ledger and does not survive service restart. The switched acceptance
proved both the first-capture and continued-capture states on the installed
generation.

## Deliberately Deferred

- command-line, environment, arbitrary VFS path, file-content, and network
  capture; the bounded exec filename above is the only path-like field;
- network eBPF hooks, VFS hooks, syscall interception, blocking, or enforcement;
- persistent event black-box storage or automatic policy/action execution;
- arbitrary probe parameters, arbitrary tracepoints, root hostd expansion,
  kernel socket peer credentials, and declarative Nix self-evolution.

## Next Slice

The bounded readback, continuity, and executable identity requirements are the
current cohesive Phase C operator loop: operators can distinguish quiet from
observed activity, see newly observed comm names, and disambiguate a process by
the exec filename without losing the raw allowlisted events. All state is
derived in memory and resets on restart. Do not add another eBPF event kind
until a new concrete operator need is demonstrated by this loop.
