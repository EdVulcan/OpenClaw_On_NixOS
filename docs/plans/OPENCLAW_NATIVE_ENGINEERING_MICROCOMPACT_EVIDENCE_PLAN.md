# OpenClaw Native Engineering Microcompact Evidence Plan

Updated: 2026-07-09

## Active Slice

Microcompact context-management evidence.

This slice migrates the useful enhanced-source `microcompact` idea into
OpenClaw-native read-model evidence. It does not rewrite transcript state. It
reads existing command transcript, verification, and recovery read models, then
calculates which historical tool-result outputs would be compactable and how
much context budget could be reclaimed.

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Endpoint

```text
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-microcompact/evidence

registry: openclaw-native-engineering-microcompact-evidence-v0
mode: context-management-evidence-only
```

Capability mapping:

```text
microcompact -> sense.openclaw.engineering_context.microcompact_evidence
```

## Implemented Behavior

The native builder:

```text
reads command transcript metadata and output lengths without returning raw output
uses a configurable threshold for compactable historical tool results
protects recent engineering evidence by default
joins verification and recovery summaries as protected evidence links
returns estimated reclaimed context characters
returns audit evidence and Observer-visible governance boundaries
```

## Deferred

The following remain deferred:

```text
runtime message mutation
persisted log mutation
automatic prompt/context rewrite
provider calls, network egress, result envelopes
command execution or retry execution
task or approval creation
```

Actual LLM-context transformation remains deferred until the read-model evidence
is stable and governed.
