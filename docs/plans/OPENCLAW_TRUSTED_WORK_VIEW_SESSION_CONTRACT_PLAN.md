# OpenClaw Trusted Work-View Session Contract Plan

Updated: 2026-07-10

## Active Slice

Identity-upgrade bridge: trusted AI work-view session contract, session-manager
owned in-process helper lease, helper readiness recommendation, explicit
Observer recovery bridge, and operator action result evidence.

This slice moves OpenClaw from a plain Level 1 user-space work-view readback
toward Level 2 trusted session/work-view behavior by making the AI-owned work
view boundary explicit in the existing session, browser, screen-sense, core, and
Observer state flow.

It does not create a root daemon, a desktop-wide capture path, a nested
compositor, a live provider path, or a new readiness-only phase.

## Real Capability

The existing work-view routes now carry a shared `trustedSession` contract:

```text
kind: openclaw-trusted-session-work-view-contract
identityLevel: level_2_trusted_session_work_view
boundary.workViewScope: ai_owned_work_view_only
operatorGates.reveal: explicit_operator_action
boundary.rootRequired: false
boundary.desktopWideCapture: false
boundary.hostMutation: false
helperReadiness.state: ready | prepared_hidden | needs_prepare | degraded
recoveryRecommendation.action: none | prepare_work_view | reveal_work_view
sidecarContract.status: drafted_not_started
sidecarContract.lifecycleProposal.status: proposal_ready
sidecarContract.approvalTaskDraft.status: draft_ready
sessionIdentity.status: authoritative | local_fallback | divergent | pending_authority
sessionIdentity.authority: openclaw-session-manager
helperRuntime.registry: openclaw-trusted-work-view-helper-runtime-v0
helperRuntime.owner: openclaw-session-manager
helperRuntime.mode: in_process_session_helper
helperRuntime.status: inactive | awaiting_browser | active | degraded | divergent
helperRuntime.leaseMatched: true | false
```

Session-manager now owns a real user-space helper lease for every prepared AI
work-view session. It rotates the lease when a new session starts, heartbeats it
on work-view actions, sends the compact lease to browser-runtime during
`/browser/open`, and records whether browser-runtime observed the same session
and lease. The shared trust contract marks the helper runtime `active` only when
the authoritative session id, browser session id, lease id, and browser lease id
match.

This is an in-process Level 2 runtime owner, not the future external sidecar.
It starts no extra process and performs no installation, root action,
desktop-wide capture, host mutation, or provider egress. Divergence is visible
and degrades trust; it is not silently repaired.

The matched lease now mediates real AI-owned browser input and click actions:

```text
screen-sense trusted state
-> screen-act derives the bounded current lease
-> browser-runtime compares it with its authoritative session lease
-> mutate browser input/click state only when the lease matches
```

The existing screen-act result carries
`openclaw-trusted-work-view-action-mediation-v0` with required, accepted,
status, session, lease, and match evidence. A session-manager-owned browser
returns HTTP 409 before mutation when an action omits or mismatches the lease.
Browser-local fallback remains compatible when no session-manager authority is
present.

The helper readiness portion makes the contract actionable without adding a new
execution path. A visible work view reports `ready` with no recovery action. A
prepared hidden work view recommends `/work-view/reveal`. A missing or degraded
browser-runtime-backed work view recommends `/work-view/prepare`. All recovery
recommendations remain user-space, Observer-visible, and root-free.

The contract now carries an explicit `sessionIdentity` block. Session-manager
is the authority for prepared/revealed work views and passes its session id into
browser-runtime when opening the AI-owned work view. Browser, screen, Phase 3,
and Observer readbacks report whether browser-runtime is matched, pending, or
divergent from that authority. This makes Level 2 work-view identity auditable
without introducing a sidecar process, daemon, root boundary, or desktop-wide
capture. Divergence degrades helper readiness and recommends the existing
`prepare_work_view` operator action; it does not automatically reset the
browser, start a sidecar, mutate the host, or call an arbitrary endpoint.

Observer now exposes a single explicit recovery bridge:

```text
Run Recommended Work View Action
```

The bridge reads `trustedSession.recoveryRecommendation` from `/work-view/state`
and maps only whitelisted actions to existing user-space endpoints:

```text
prepare_work_view -> POST /work-view/prepare
reveal_work_view -> POST /work-view/reveal
hide_work_view -> POST /work-view/hide
none -> no mutation
```

It does not call arbitrary endpoints returned by the service contract.

Observer also exposes the trusted sidecar lifecycle probe through the same
Controls surface:

```text
Run Sidecar Start Probe
```

The control resolves the latest sidecar lifecycle task through
`/phase-3/operator-interrupt-controls` and calls the existing
`/work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks/:taskId/start-probe` route. It
intentionally accepts the pre-approval HTTP 409 response as a valid readback so
the operator can see `blocked_before_approval`; after manual approval it reads
`running_after_approval` with bounded PID and heartbeat evidence.

The contract carries the Level 2 sidecar lifecycle and keeps process start
disabled until an explicit task approval. It names the helper's future
capture/action/recovery responsibilities while the current pilot performs only
IPC heartbeat. No installation or root/system daemon is used.

The materialized lifecycle task exposes the approved bounded start action on the
same route group:

```text
POST /work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks/:taskId/start-probe
```

Before approval the probe returns `blocked_before_approval` with HTTP 409 and
records that no process was started, no root/system daemon is required, no
desktop-wide capture is used, no host mutation occurs, and no provider egress is
performed. After the operator approves the lifecycle task, the same action
starts one session-manager-owned user-space process and returns
`running_after_approval` with its PID and IPC heartbeat. The process receives a
sanitized environment, performs no filesystem or network operation, requires no
installation or root authority, and exits through the task-scoped `/stop`
action. Start and stop are recorded on the existing lifecycle task and
consolidated into `/phase-3/operator-interrupt-controls`.

Every work-view prepare/reveal/hide call now records `lastOperatorAction` in the
existing work-view state. The record includes:

```text
action
source
recommendedAction
endpoint
previous status/visibility/mode/helper/browser/URL
next status/visibility/mode/helper/browser/URL
rootRequired: false
hostMutation: false
operatorVisible: true
```

This makes recovery action results visible through `/work-view/state` and
`/phase-3/background-work-view` without adding another evidence endpoint.

When an Observer work-view action runs while a task is selected, the existing
task phase update now carries a compact recovery attachment:

```text
details.workViewRecoveryAction
details.trustedSession.identityLevel
details.trustedSession.helperReadiness
details.trustedSession.recoveryRecommendation
details.trustedSession.sidecarContract.status
details.trustedSession.sidecarContract.lifecycleProposal.status
details.trustedSession.sidecarContract.approvalTaskDraft.status
```

This keeps task/workbench continuity tied to the same `/tasks/:id/phase` path
instead of adding a separate recovery-result route.

The contract is emitted through:

```text
GET /work-view/state
GET /session/state
GET /browser/capture
GET /screen/current
GET /phase-3/background-work-view
GET /phase-3/operator-interrupt-controls
POST /work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks
POST /work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks/:taskId/start-probe
POST /work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks/:taskId/stop
Observer work-view and screen panels
```

## Operator Takeover Action Authority

The trusted helper lease now carries an explicit `actionAuthority` state. The
existing operator controls close the user-sovereignty loop without adding a new
public readiness route:

```text
POST /control/takeover
-> session-manager suspends the current helper action authority
-> browser-runtime stores the suspended lease
-> screen-act blocks before browser mutation
-> browser-runtime rejects even a directly submitted matching old lease

POST /control/resume
-> session-manager issues a new lease id
-> browser-runtime explicitly rebinds the new lease
-> the paused task returns to queued only after rebind succeeds
-> browser input/click can continue with the new lease
```

The internal user-space propagation routes are
`/work-view/helper-authority/suspend`,
`/work-view/helper-authority/resume`, and
`/browser/trusted-helper-lease`. They do not start an external process, mutate
the host, capture the desktop, read credentials, or perform provider egress.
The existing Phase 3 controls readback and Observer panel expose runtime status,
action authority, suspension state, and current lease id.

## User-Space Sidecar Pilot

The approved lifecycle task now owns a real bounded process:

```text
core lifecycle task + approved approval id
-> session-manager sidecar supervisor
-> minimal Node child with IPC only
-> ready/heartbeat messages update the authoritative helper lease
-> work-view state and Observer show PID, supervisor status, and heartbeat count
-> explicit task-scoped stop terminates the child and records stopped readback
```

The supervisor does not inherit the parent credential environment. The child
contains no filesystem, network, browser, provider, desktop-capture, or host
mutation implementation. Parent IPC disconnect also terminates it, so it cannot
remain orphaned after session-manager exits.

## Deferred

The following remain intentionally deferred:

```text
desktop-wide GNOME/Wayland capture
sidecar installation or login-session persistence
root/system daemon or polkit integration
nested compositor or graphics-stack-native workspace
host mutation and input execution beyond existing governed user-space paths
provider egress or credential access
automatic recovery execution; the contract recommends existing operator actions
unreviewed endpoint invocation from recommendation payloads
trusted-lease mediation for keyboard hotkey/window-focus paths that do not yet
mutate browser-runtime state
sidecar-owned browser capture/action transport; this pilot owns heartbeat only
automatic sidecar restart after crash or heartbeat timeout
```

## Next Slice

The approved user-space sidecar now backs helper readiness with a real IPC
heartbeat and supports explicit stop. The next Level 2 slice should make loss of
that heartbeat fail closed:

```text
unexpected sidecar exit or heartbeat timeout
-> helper readiness becomes degraded
-> AI action authority is suspended
-> Observer recommends explicit approved restart
-> no automatic restart
```

It should extend the same supervisor, lifecycle task, work-view contract, and
Observer controls rather than add another readiness chain. Root/system daemon
work, desktop-wide capture, graphics-stack integration, automatic restart, and
provider egress remain deferred.
