# OpenClaw Trusted Work-View Session Contract Plan

Updated: 2026-07-10

## Active Slice

Identity-upgrade bridge: trusted AI work-view session contract, session-manager
owned in-process helper lease, helper readiness recommendation, explicit
Observer recovery bridge, and operator action result evidence.

This slice moves OpenClaw from a plain Level 1 user-space work-view readback
toward Level 2 trusted session/work-view behavior by making the AI-owned work
view boundary explicit in the existing session, browser, screen-sense, core, and
Observer state flow.

It does not create a root daemon, a desktop-wide capture path, a nested
compositor, a live provider path, or a new readiness-only phase.

## Real Capability

The existing work-view routes now carry a shared `trustedSession` contract:

```text
kind: openclaw-trusted-session-work-view-contract
identityLevel: level_2_trusted_session_work_view
boundary.workViewScope: ai_owned_work_view_only
operatorGates.reveal: explicit_operator_action
boundary.rootRequired: false
boundary.desktopWideCapture: false
boundary.hostMutation: false
helperReadiness.state: ready | prepared_hidden | needs_prepare | degraded
recoveryRecommendation.action: none | prepare_work_view | reveal_work_view
sidecarContract.status: drafted_not_started
sidecarContract.lifecycleProposal.status: proposal_ready
sidecarContract.approvalTaskDraft.status: draft_ready
sessionIdentity.status: authoritative | local_fallback | divergent | pending_authority
sessionIdentity.authority: openclaw-session-manager
helperRuntime.registry: openclaw-trusted-work-view-helper-runtime-v0
helperRuntime.owner: openclaw-session-manager
helperRuntime.mode: in_process_session_helper
helperRuntime.status: inactive | awaiting_browser | active | degraded | divergent
helperRuntime.leaseMatched: true | false
```

Session-manager now owns a real user-space helper lease for every prepared AI
work-view session. It rotates the lease when a new session starts, heartbeats it
on work-view actions, sends the compact lease to browser-runtime during
`/browser/open`, and records whether browser-runtime observed the same session
and lease. The shared trust contract marks the helper runtime `active` only when
the authoritative session id, browser session id, lease id, and browser lease id
match.

This is an in-process Level 2 runtime owner, not the future external sidecar.
It starts no extra process and performs no installation, root action,
desktop-wide capture, host mutation, or provider egress. Divergence is visible
and degrades trust; it is not silently repaired.

The matched lease now mediates real AI-owned browser input and click actions:

```text
screen-sense trusted state
-> screen-act derives the bounded current lease
-> browser-runtime compares it with its authoritative session lease
-> mutate browser input/click state only when the lease matches
```

The existing screen-act result carries
`openclaw-trusted-work-view-action-mediation-v0` with required, accepted,
status, session, lease, and match evidence. A session-manager-owned browser
returns HTTP 409 before mutation when an action omits or mismatches the lease.
Browser-local fallback remains compatible when no session-manager authority is
present.

The helper readiness portion makes the contract actionable without adding a new
execution path. A visible work view reports `ready` with no recovery action. A
prepared hidden work view recommends `/work-view/reveal`. A missing or degraded
browser-runtime-backed work view recommends `/work-view/prepare`. All recovery
recommendations remain user-space, Observer-visible, and root-free.

The contract now carries an explicit `sessionIdentity` block. Session-manager
is the authority for prepared/revealed work views and passes its session id into
browser-runtime when opening the AI-owned work view. Browser, screen, Phase 3,
and Observer readbacks report whether browser-runtime is matched, pending, or
divergent from that authority. This makes Level 2 work-view identity auditable
without introducing a sidecar process, daemon, root boundary, or desktop-wide
capture. Divergence degrades helper readiness and recommends the existing
`prepare_work_view` operator action; it does not automatically reset the
browser, start a sidecar, mutate the host, or call an arbitrary endpoint.

Observer now exposes a single explicit recovery bridge:

```text
Run Recommended Work View Action
```

The bridge reads `trustedSession.recoveryRecommendation` from `/work-view/state`
and maps only whitelisted actions to existing user-space endpoints:

```text
prepare_work_view -> POST /work-view/prepare
reveal_work_view -> POST /work-view/reveal
hide_work_view -> POST /work-view/hide
none -> no mutation
```

It does not call arbitrary endpoints returned by the service contract.

Observer also exposes the trusted sidecar lifecycle probe through the same
Controls surface:

```text
Run Sidecar Start Probe
```

The control resolves the latest sidecar lifecycle task through
`/phase-3/operator-interrupt-controls` and calls the existing
`/work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks/:taskId/start-probe` route. It
intentionally accepts the pre-approval HTTP 409 response as a valid readback so
the operator can see `blocked_before_approval`; after manual approval it reads
`deferred_after_approval`. Both states preserve `processStarted: false`, no
root/system daemon requirement, no desktop-wide capture, no host mutation, and
no provider egress.

The contract also carries a future Level 2 sidecar draft. It names the helper's
capture/action/recovery/Observer responsibilities and explicitly records that no
process is started, no installation is required, and no root/system daemon is
used in this slice. The lifecycle proposal records the future approval gate and
keeps execution deferred. The approval task materialization creates an explicit
task and pending approval while keeping process start disabled.

The materialized lifecycle task now exposes a bounded start-probe readback on
the same route group:

```text
POST /work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks/:taskId/start-probe
```

Before approval the probe returns `blocked_before_approval` with HTTP 409 and
records that no process was started, no root/system daemon is required, no
desktop-wide capture is used, no host mutation occurs, and no provider egress is
performed. After the operator approves the lifecycle task, the same probe
returns `deferred_after_approval` while preserving the same non-execution flags.
This proves the approval bridge and deferred execution boundary without
starting a helper process. Each probe is recorded on the existing lifecycle task
and consolidated into `/phase-3/operator-interrupt-controls`, so the Observer
Phase 3 controls panel can show the latest task, approval, probe status, and
non-execution flags without a new evidence endpoint.

Every work-view prepare/reveal/hide call now records `lastOperatorAction` in the
existing work-view state. The record includes:

```text
action
source
recommendedAction
endpoint
previous status/visibility/mode/helper/browser/URL
next status/visibility/mode/helper/browser/URL
rootRequired: false
hostMutation: false
operatorVisible: true
```

This makes recovery action results visible through `/work-view/state` and
`/phase-3/background-work-view` without adding another evidence endpoint.

When an Observer work-view action runs while a task is selected, the existing
task phase update now carries a compact recovery attachment:

```text
details.workViewRecoveryAction
details.trustedSession.identityLevel
details.trustedSession.helperReadiness
details.trustedSession.recoveryRecommendation
details.trustedSession.sidecarContract.status
details.trustedSession.sidecarContract.lifecycleProposal.status
details.trustedSession.sidecarContract.approvalTaskDraft.status
```

This keeps task/workbench continuity tied to the same `/tasks/:id/phase` path
instead of adding a separate recovery-result route.

The contract is emitted through:

```text
GET /work-view/state
GET /session/state
GET /browser/capture
GET /screen/current
GET /phase-3/background-work-view
GET /phase-3/operator-interrupt-controls
POST /work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks
POST /work-view/trusted-sidecar/lifecycle-tasks/:taskId/start-probe
Observer work-view and screen panels
```

## Operator Takeover Action Authority

The trusted helper lease now carries an explicit `actionAuthority` state. The
existing operator controls close the user-sovereignty loop without adding a new
public readiness route:

```text
POST /control/takeover
-> session-manager suspends the current helper action authority
-> browser-runtime stores the suspended lease
-> screen-act blocks before browser mutation
-> browser-runtime rejects even a directly submitted matching old lease

POST /control/resume
-> session-manager issues a new lease id
-> browser-runtime explicitly rebinds the new lease
-> the paused task returns to queued only after rebind succeeds
-> browser input/click can continue with the new lease
```

The internal user-space propagation routes are
`/work-view/helper-authority/suspend`,
`/work-view/helper-authority/resume`, and
`/browser/trusted-helper-lease`. They do not start an external process, mutate
the host, capture the desktop, read credentials, or perform provider egress.
The existing Phase 3 controls readback and Observer panel expose runtime status,
action authority, suspension state, and current lease id.

## Deferred

The following remain intentionally deferred:

```text
desktop-wide GNOME/Wayland capture
external session helper process or sidecar installation
root/system daemon or polkit integration
nested compositor or graphics-stack-native workspace
host mutation and input execution beyond existing governed user-space paths
provider egress or credential access
automatic recovery execution; the contract recommends existing operator actions
unreviewed endpoint invocation from recommendation payloads
actual external trusted sidecar process start after approval
trusted-lease mediation for keyboard hotkey/window-focus paths that do not yet
mutate browser-runtime state
external helper ownership of the lease heartbeat; the current helper remains
in-process and session-manager-owned
```

## Next Slice

The matched helper lease is now enforced for browser input and click actions,
and explicit operator takeover suspends that authority until resume rotates and
rebinds the lease. The next Level 2 slice should move one real runtime
responsibility out of the in-process placeholder:

```text
approved user-space trusted helper process pilot
-> session-manager supervision
-> process heartbeat backs lease readiness
-> explicit stop and recovery readback
```

It should reuse the existing trusted-sidecar lifecycle task and approval rather
than add another readiness chain. The process must be bounded, user-space,
session-manager-owned, non-installed, and unable to capture the desktop or
mutate the host. Root/system daemon work, desktop-wide capture, graphics-stack
integration, and provider egress remain deferred.
