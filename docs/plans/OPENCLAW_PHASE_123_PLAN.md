# OpenClaw Phase 123 Plan: Live Provider Credential Value Local Read Execution Local Read Attempt Local Read Result Envelope Creation Execution Attempt Local Read Result Envelope Creation Route

Phase 123 starts after `openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-credential-value-local-read-execution-local-read-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-execution-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-final-readiness-preflight`. Phase 122 recorded final readiness before any local read result envelope creation route while keeping credential values unread and result envelopes uncreated.

## Purpose

Route toward an approval-gated local read result envelope creation path for the Phase 119+ result-envelope lane. This keeps OpenClaw's local-first cloud consciousness provider body moving toward real provider execution while preserving explicit gates between readiness, result envelope creation, credential value reads, endpoint contact, and live provider calls.

This phase still does not read credential values, create a result envelope, contact provider endpoints, or perform network egress.

## Milestone Slice

1. `openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-credential-value-local-read-execution-local-read-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-execution-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-route`
   - Requires Phase 122 credential value local read execution local-read attempt local-read result envelope creation execution attempt local-read result envelope final readiness preflight evidence.
   - Exposes `GET /cloud-consciousness/live-provider-credential-value-local-read-execution-local-read-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-execution-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-route`.
   - Selects `openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-credential-value-local-read-execution-local-read-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-execution-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-task-shell` as the next slice.
   - Keeps `credentialValueLocalReadExecutionLocalReadAttemptLocalReadResultEnvelopeCreationExecutionAttemptLocalReadResultEnvelopeFinalReadinessPreflightRecorded: true`.
   - Keeps `credentialValueLocalReadExecutionLocalReadAttemptLocalReadResultEnvelopeCreationExecutionAttemptLocalReadResultEnvelopeCreationTaskCreated: false`.
   - Keeps `credentialValueLocalReadExecutionLocalReadAttemptLocalReadResultEnvelopeCreated: false`.
   - Keeps `credentialValueRead: false`, `credentialValueIncluded: false`, `credentialValueExposed: false`, and `providerCredentialRead: false`.
   - Keeps endpoint contact, network egress, provider response creation, rollback execution, host mutation, and live provider calls disabled.

2. `observer-openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-credential-value-local-read-execution-local-read-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-execution-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-route`
   - Shows credential value local read execution local-read attempt local-read result envelope creation execution attempt local-read result envelope creation route in Observer.
   - Displays readiness, source task, credential state, result envelope creation state, network state, endpoint, and next recommended slice.

## Deferred

- Creating the approval-gated result envelope creation task shell.
- Actually reading credential values.
- Exposing credential values in API responses, task summaries, logs, or Observer.
- Building a local read result envelope.
- Authorizing endpoint/network egress.
- Contacting any provider endpoint.
- Performing network egress.
- Creating a provider response from a live call.
- Executing rollback or mutating host state.
- Enabling an actual live provider call.

## Next Likely Slice

`openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-credential-value-local-read-execution-local-read-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-execution-attempt-local-read-result-envelope-creation-task-shell`: approval-gated shell for creating local read result envelope evidence while still keeping credential value reads and provider/network egress separate future gates.
