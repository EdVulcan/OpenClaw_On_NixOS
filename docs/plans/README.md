# OpenClaw Plans Directory

Updated: 2026-07-10

This directory contains both active route documents and historical milestone
evidence. Do not infer the next development task from the highest numbered phase
file.

## Current Route Correction

The current route is no longer "continue to the next numbered cloud-provider
phase." The corrected route is:

```text
preserve enhanced openclaw source on GitHub
-> perform enhanced source gap audit
-> migrate governed engineering tool capabilities into OpenClawOnNixOS
-> return to identity-upgrade work-view/session-helper/hostd route
```

Current native engineering plan/todo storage and suggested-action Observer
bridge evidence is documented in:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_PLAN_TODO_WORKBENCH_STORAGE_PLAN.md
```

That lane now preserves compact persisted-workbench provenance through existing
edit/write/verification task readback. The Level 1 engineering loop should not
grow another evidence/readiness shell; continue with the smallest real Level 2
trusted work-view/session-helper capability.

The active Level 2 bridge is documented in:

```text
OPENCLAW_TRUSTED_WORK_VIEW_SESSION_CONTRACT_PLAN.md
```

It now closes browser action mediation through operator takeover suspension and
explicit resume/rebind, then runs a bounded approval-gated user-space helper
heartbeat process under the existing sidecar lifecycle. Fail-closed recovery
across session-manager restart now persists compact intent, revokes the old
browser lease, avoids automatic child resurrection, and reuses the approved
task for explicit restart. Browser-runtime restart continuity now blocks actions
on capture-source loss, recommends prepare through the existing Observer path,
and recovers capture plus sidecar IPC without restarting the helper. The next
real slice is bounded browser navigation/new-tab through the same trusted
transport. That operator-facing action is now complete with bounded URL
validation, lease/capture gates, real tab mutation, refreshed capture, and an
Observer control. Its core planner/task-executor bridge is complete with shared
production descriptors, compact sidecar
effect evidence, and post-action capture verification. The next real slice is
in-flight browser task recovery across capture-source interruption. That
bounded recovery now performs one prepare and one retry only for sidecar capture
reasons and records compact action evidence. Active-task continuity across
session-manager restart now persists recoverable authority-interruption
evidence, explicitly restores the session and approved sidecar, and executes
only unfinished steps from the preserved browser plan. Active-task startup
reconciliation across core process restart is also complete: persisted running
browser plans become recoverable evidence while queued/paused tasks are
preserved, and recovery executes pending work through the still-running sidecar.
The next real Level 2 slice is independently supervised user-session sidecar
ownership with fail-closed disconnect and explicit fresh-lease reconnect. Do
not add a readiness milestone, automatic action restart, root/system daemon,
fault-injection endpoint, or desktop-wide capture.

That slice is complete: the bounded current-user socket sidecar survives
session-manager restart without retaining action authority, and the existing
approved lifecycle action reconnects the same PID only after a fresh work-view
session exists. The next real reliability slice is explicit approved
replacement after the sidecar process itself exits; no automatic replacement,
new panel, or readiness chain is needed.

That replacement slice is complete: unexpected PID exit suspends action
authority and the existing approved lifecycle starts a different PID before
capture/actions resume. The remaining Level 2 ownership slice is a declarative,
non-auto-started `systemd --user` unit path for the same sidecar process. It must
reuse the current approval/socket/recovery contracts and must not create a root
service or parallel lifecycle API.

The non-auto-started user-unit contract is now present in the desktop-body Nix
profile and proven through the existing `body-config` milestone. Runtime still
uses direct spawn. The next slice is the approval-preserving launcher bridge to
that fixed template instance, including explicit stop and existing Observer
readback; it is not another unit/readiness document.

## Historical Phase Plans

`OPENCLAW_PHASE_2_PLAN.md` through `OPENCLAW_PHASE_136_PLAN.md` are retained
because milestone scripts and runtime evidence still reference them.

They are historical records and check fixtures. They are not the live roadmap.

Do not delete, rename, or move them until the milestone scripts that read them
are updated.

## Cleanup Rule

When adding a new plan:

- Prefer updating an active route document over creating another numbered phase.
- Create a new numbered phase only when a real capability slice needs an
  executable milestone check.
- If the document is historical evidence, say so at the top.
- If the document is active guidance, link it from this README and from
  `docs/README.md`.
