# OpenClaw Phase 64 Plan: Live Provider Egress Execution Approved Deferred

Phase 64 starts after `openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-egress-execution-task-shell`. Phase 63 created and approved an egress execution task shell while keeping endpoint contact and network egress deferred.

## Purpose

Expose the approved-deferred egress execution shell as stable local evidence for the next provider-call gate. This gives future phases a queryable body-owned proof that operator approval happened, the task completed, and execution still did not cross the credential or network boundary.

This advances the whitepaper line by making cloud-consciousness cooperation auditable inside the local autonomous body before any real endpoint contact.

## Milestone Slice

1. `openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-egress-execution-approved-deferred`
   - Requires Phase 63 approved egress execution task shell evidence.
   - Exposes `/cloud-consciousness/live-provider-egress-execution-approved-deferred`.
   - Reports `approvedDeferredEvidenceFound: true`, `egressExecutionTaskApproved: true`, and `egressExecutionDeferred: true`.
   - Keeps credential value access, endpoint contact, network egress, provider response creation, rollback execution, host mutation, and live provider calls disabled.

2. `observer-openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-egress-execution-approved-deferred`
   - Shows the approved-deferred egress execution evidence in Observer.
   - Displays readiness, source task, network state, and next recommended slice.

## Deferred

- Reading credential values.
- Authorizing endpoint/network egress.
- Contacting any provider endpoint.
- Performing network egress.
- Creating a provider response from a live call.
- Executing rollback or mutating host state.
- Enabling an actual live provider call.

## Next Likely Slice

`openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-credential-value-authorization-route`: define the explicit operator route for future credential-value authorization without reading the value yet.
