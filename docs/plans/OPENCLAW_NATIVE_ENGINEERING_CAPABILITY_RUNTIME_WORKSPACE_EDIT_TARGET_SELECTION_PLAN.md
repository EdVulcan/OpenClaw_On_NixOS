# OpenClaw Native Engineering Capability Runtime Workspace Edit Target Selection Plan

Updated: 2026-07-16

## Active Slice

Expose the existing bounded source-derived workspace edit target selection
through the common `POST /capabilities/invoke` runtime as:

```text
sense.openclaw.workspace_edit_target_select
```

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Demonstrated Gap

The native plugin descriptor, direct target-selection route, and builder already
existed. The common capability descriptor did not include the capability, so
the capability registry could not discover it and `/capabilities/invoke` could
not apply the normal policy, invocation ledger, or capability-event path.

## Implemented Behavior

The common descriptor now points to the existing
`/plugins/native-adapter/workspace-edit-target-selection` route. A focused
runtime handler delegates bounded `workspacePath`, `scope`, `query`, and
`limit` inputs to the existing builder and returns a compact invocation summary
with:

```text
registry, scope, candidate count, selected state, selected relative path
canFeedPatchProposal
no source-content exposure
no mutation, task creation, approval creation, plugin execution, or runtime activation
canCallProvider=false, canUseNetwork=false, noProviderEgress=true
```

The direct route remains the detailed target-selection read model used by the
existing workspace proposal and Observer surfaces. The common runtime now
provides the canonical policy, invocation, and event boundary without creating
a second selection algorithm or mutation path.

## Governance

```text
audit-only local body sensor
source files may be read internally for derived metadata, but file bodies remain transient and are not in the invocation summary
declaration previews remain bounded metadata; function bodies are not exposed
no file mutation, task creation, or approval creation
no plugin-code execution or runtime activation
no provider call or network use
```

## Evidence

Runtime and focused unit test:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/capability-runtime-workspace-edit-target.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/capability-runtime.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/capability-descriptors.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/capability-runtime-workspace-edit-target.test.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/plugin-review-workspace-intelligence.test.mjs
```

Real Core and Observer checks reuse the existing target-selection lifecycle:

```text
nix/scripts/dev-openclaw-workspace-edit-target-selection-check.sh
nix/scripts/dev-observer-openclaw-workspace-edit-target-selection-check.sh
```

Both checks invoke the common capability against the same local fixture and
assert selected-target identity, proposal eligibility, source-content
redaction, and every negative authority boundary.

## Deferred

```text
automatic edit proposal or task creation from target selection
automatic approval or patch execution
provider or network egress
plugin module import, plugin-code execution, and runtime activation
root/system daemon work and arbitrary workspace paths
```

The target-selection capability closes this declared/runtime boundary. Do not
open another horizontal read-only bridge unless a concrete operator gap appears;
the next route remains the smallest real Level 2 trusted work-view/session
capability.
