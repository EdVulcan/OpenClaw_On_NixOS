# OpenClaw Enhanced Source Migration Brief

Updated: 2026-07-09

This brief exists so a VM-side agent can understand an important project truth:
the main `OpenClawOnNixOS` repository has absorbed many enhanced `openclaw`
ideas through governed source-integration milestones, but the concrete locally
optimized `openclaw` source changes from the Windows host have not been fully
merged into this repository yet.

Read this file before continuing new phases that claim to improve coding
capability, Claude Code parity, source integration, plugin runtime ergonomics, or
agent token efficiency.

## Source Situation

Primary project repository:

```text
/home/edvulcan/OpenClaw_On_NixOS
```

Windows host source repository containing the local enhanced implementation:

```text
D:\OpenclawAndClaudecode\openclaw
```

The VM cannot assume those local Windows-only changes are present after a normal
`git pull` of `EdVulcan/OpenClaw_On_NixOS`. They are source material for the
next integration pass, not already-integrated code.

## Why This Matters

The project goal is not to keep adding milestone wrappers. OpenClaw is a
NixOS-based local autonomous agent body with user sovereignty, body sovereignty,
observable execution, recoverable actions, memory, and eventually live provider
collaboration.

The enhanced `openclaw` work captured several practical advantages from Claude
Code-style development:

- precise code reading and surgical editing tools
- fast codebase search and symbol navigation
- structured planning and persistent task tracking
- verification-first coding loops
- token-pressure reduction through microcompaction
- live plugin runtime refresh after install/enable/disable
- cross-platform ACP/Codex bridge compatibility fixes
- stronger engineering behavior prompts

Those advantages should be absorbed into `OpenClawOnNixOS` as native,
policy-governed body capabilities. They should not be forgotten while later
cloud/provider phases continue.

## Local Enhanced Source Inventory

These paths were observed as uncommitted or untracked changes in the Windows
host `openclaw` repository on 2026-07-09:

```

Temporary/local files also existed and should not be blindly migrated:

```text
.openclaw/workspace-state.json
help.txt
temp_test.txt
```

## Capability Themes To Preserve

### 1. CC Tools Engineering Surface

Observed intent: add Claude Code-grade tools to the enhanced `openclaw` agent
runtime:

```text
cc_read
cc_edit
cc_write
cc_glob
cc_grep
cc_plan_enter
cc_plan_exit
cc_todo_write
cc_lsp
cc_verify
```

OpenClawOnNixOS target: absorb these as native workspace-engineering
capabilities behind existing policy, approval, audit ledger, observer visibility,
workspace scoping, and recovery semantics.

Do not simply copy a standalone tool bundle and bypass the body-governance
chain. The useful capability is "precise, verifiable engineering action by a
local body," not just the tool names.

### 2. Microcompact Token Pressure Control

Observed intent: compress old large tool results in-memory before model calls
while preserving persisted session logs.

OpenClawOnNixOS target: treat this as a local memory/context-management
capability. It should preserve recent turns, keep audit/source logs intact, and
emit evidence about reclaimed context budget without hiding current evidence
needed for verification.

### 3. Live Plugin Runtime Refresh

Observed intent: after `/plugins install`, enable, or disable, refresh the active
plugin runtime without requiring a gateway restart.

OpenClawOnNixOS target: integrate as governed runtime lifecycle management:
operator-visible, auditable, recoverable, and safe for setup-only/channel-scoped
plugins.

### 4. ACP/Codex Bridge Compatibility

Observed intent: fix Windows `npx.cmd` and wrapper execution behavior for the
Codex ACP bridge, plus add runtime persistence tests.

OpenClawOnNixOS target: preserve the compatibility insight where relevant, but
adapt it to the NixOS body and VM/host bridge model instead of treating Windows
wrapper behavior as the main runtime path.

### 5. Engineering Prompt Semantics

Observed intent: add Claude Code-style engineering directives:

```text
precise edits over full rewrites
no gold plating
blast-radius control
evidence before report
plan before acting
```

OpenClawOnNixOS target: encode these as agent conduct and observer-verifiable
work standards, not as an ungoverned prompt wall. They should support the
whitepaper goal of reliable local autonomy.

### 6. UI And Identity Notes

Observed intent: improve UI styling and add local project notes such as
`HEARTBEAT.md`, `SOUL.md`, and `TOOLS.md`.

OpenClawOnNixOS target: classify these separately. Some may become operator UX,
project identity, or agent conduct docs. They are not equal priority with the
engineering capability layer.

## Required VM Agent Reading Order

Before continuing a new source-integration or coding-capability phase, read:

```bash
cd /home/edvulcan/OpenClaw_On_NixOS
git status --short
git log -10 --oneline
sed -n '1,220p' docs/plans/OPENCLAW_ENHANCED_SOURCE_MIGRATION_BRIEF.md
sed -n '1,260p' docs/plans/OPENCLAW_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_STAGE_PLAN.md
find docs -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort | grep -Ei 'whitepaper|source|integration|plugin|workspace|tool|runtime|memory|body'
```

Then answer with evidence:

```text
1. Which enhanced source capabilities are already absorbed?
2. Which are only planned or represented as metadata?
3. Which require real source transfer from the Windows enhanced openclaw repo?
4. Which next slice creates actual product capability instead of another
   readiness wrapper?
```

## Transfer Options If The VM Needs Source

The VM agent should not fabricate source details if the Windows enhanced source
is unavailable. Use one of these transfer paths:

```powershell
# On Windows host, produce a tracked diff for modified files.
git -C D:\OpenclawAndClaudecode\openclaw diff --binary > D:\OpenclawAndClaudecode\enhanced-openclaw-local.diff

# Also archive untracked source files that are part of the intended migration.
# Exclude .openclaw/workspace-state.json, help.txt, and temp_test.txt unless a
# human explicitly says otherwise.
```

Alternative preferred long-term path:

```text
Commit the enhanced openclaw work to a dedicated branch or fork, then let the VM
agent inspect that branch as an external source reference.
```

## Integration Rules

- Do not wholesale-copy the enhanced `openclaw` repo into `OpenClawOnNixOS`.
- Do not import old runtime modules as hidden dependencies.
- Do not bypass policy, approval, audit, observer, or workspace scoping.
- Do not spend many phases on safety-only shells without moving capability.
- Prefer small vertical slices that prove a real body capability.
- Every slice must name the user-visible capability, evidence artifact,
  remaining deferred boundary, and next capability step.
- Keep code decoupled; do not recreate a giant core file.

## Recommended Next Slice

Create an "enhanced source migration gap audit" that compares the existing
`OpenClawOnNixOS` source-integration milestones against the inventory above.

The audit should classify each capability as:

```text
absorbed
partially absorbed
not absorbed
should not migrate
requires source transfer
```

After the audit, prioritize the highest-value real capability:

```text
Native governed engineering tool surface:
read -> grep/glob -> surgical edit proposal -> verification command ->
observer evidence -> recovery/audit.
```

This directly advances the whitepaper direction because it makes the local body
better at controlled self-development, not merely better at passing milestone
checks.
