# OpenClaw Native Engineering Write Closed Loop Plan

Updated: 2026-07-18

## Active Slice

Native governed engineering write closed-loop proof.

This slice does not add another read-only endpoint. It proves that the existing
`cc_write`-derived proposal path can complete the product loop:

```text
bounded read/search -> write proposal -> approval task ->
operator-approved workspace_text_write -> filesystem ledger ->
Observer visibility -> approved or bounded sovereign verification command ->
recovery readback
```

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Implemented Behavior

The milestone proof:

```text
creates a confirmed engineering write proposal task
starts from existing bounded read, glob, and grep surfaces
blocks operator execution before approval
approves the task through the approval API
executes the existing workspace_text_write path through operator step
verifies the target file changed only after approval
checks filesystem write invocation history and filesystem ledger
checks write execution readback without exposing file content
fetches Observer HTML/client tokens for write, verification, and recovery panels
creates an approval-gated verification command task
approves and executes verification through the existing command path
checks verification evidence is attached to task completion
checks recovery readback reports no failures for the successful verification
in `guardian`, keeps verification approval-gated
in `sovereign_body`, creates and executes at most one bound low-risk validation
  follow-up after the completed mutation
renders the completed follow-up in the existing Observer Engineering Loop State
and Task History without a new route or execution owner
```

No new endpoint, provider egress, credential read, root daemon, or hidden
enhanced-source import is introduced.

The sovereign follow-up is not write autonomy. The write still requires its
existing explicit approval and operator execution path. Only the validation
task can use the standing authorization, and only when its command shape,
task/step binding, and source mutation hash all match.

## Evidence

Validation target:

```text
openclaw-native-engineering-write-closed-loop
```

Script:

```text
nix/scripts/dev-openclaw-native-engineering-write-closed-loop-check.sh
```

The check uses existing runtime surfaces:

```text
POST /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-write-proposal-tasks
POST /approvals/:id/approve
POST /operator/step
GET /filesystem/changes
GET /capabilities/invocations
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-write-execution/evidence
POST /plugins/native-adapter/source-command-proposals/tasks
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-verification/evidence
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-recovery/evidence
GET / and /client-v5.js from Observer
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-read-search/read
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-read-search/glob
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-read-search/grep
```

## Deferred

The following remain deferred:

```text
automatic approval
automatic command execution outside the fixed `sovereign_body` validation
  follow-up
automatic recovery task creation
automatic verification retry or recovery rerun
provider calls, network egress, result envelopes
raw credential reads
```

## Follow-Up Status

The recommended edit closed-loop follow-up was completed as:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_EDIT_CLOSED_LOOP_PLAN.md
```

That slice proves edit proposal -> approval-gated workspace_patch_apply ->
ledger -> Observer -> verification/recovery, with only a thin execution
readback and no readiness chain.

The bounded write-validation autonomy follow-up is covered in this same lane:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/task-executor-verification-followup.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/task-executor-verification-followup.test.mjs
```

The real check runs both `guardian` and `sovereign_body` branches through the
same user-space service lifecycle.

The Observer readback follow-up is now also closed. It reads the existing task
outcome and displays the source task, mutation-hash binding status, validation
task, autonomy mode, and result. It adds no command, approval, retry, recovery,
provider, or workspace authority.

## Next Slice

The operator ergonomics follow-up was completed as:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LOOP_OPERATOR_CONTROLS_PLAN.md
```

The parameterized workbench-input slice is already implemented. The Observer
follow-up readback is also complete; select the next real capability from the
active forward-work directive instead of extending this loop with another
readiness or mirror surface.
