# OpenClaw Native Engineering LSP Symbol Request Task Plan

Updated: 2026-07-12

## Active Slice

Approval-gated LSP symbol request task.

This slice follows the read-only symbol request proposal. It creates a task from
approved `textDocument/didOpen` state, blocks execution before explicit
approval, rebuilds the short-lived LSP setup after approval, sends exactly one
selected `textDocument/definition`, `textDocument/references`, or
`textDocument/hover` request, and records bounded task/lifecycle-state evidence.

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Endpoint And Registries

```text
POST /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-lsp/lifecycle-tasks
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-lsp/lifecycle-state

lifecycleAction: symbol_request
task registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-task-v0
execution registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-execution-v0
state registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-state-v0
proposal registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-symbol-request-proposal-v0
```

Capability mapping:

```text
plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_symbol_request
act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_symbol_request_task
sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle_state
```

## Implemented Behavior

The `symbol_request` task:

```text
requires confirm=true task creation
requires an approved didOpen source-transfer lifecycle state
requires explicit approval before execution
keeps proposal request metadata in task readback with sent=false until approval
checks the mapped language-server binary only after approval
re-reads and hash-checks the bounded source file after approval
starts a short-lived user-space language-server process in the bounded workspace
sends initialize, textDocument/didOpen, exactly one selected symbol request, shutdown, and exit
records symbol request method/id/response-observed metadata
records lifecycle state with jsonRpcOperationalRequestsEnabled=true
keeps long-lived process pools disabled
does not store or return the source file body in execution evidence
```

## Boundaries

This slice still blocks:

```text
long-lived language-server process pools
automatic retries and automatic recovery execution
package installation and PATH mutation
provider calls, network egress, root/system daemon work
workspace mutation
unapproved symbol requests
```

It intentionally changes the previous boundary:

```text
after approval, exactly one definition/references/hover request may be sent to a short-lived user-space LSP process
```

## Evidence

Runtime:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-tasks.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/native-engineering-lsp-protocol-handshake.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-state.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/workspace-native-ops-routes.mjs
```

Validation targets:

```text
services/openclaw-core/test/task-executor.test.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/workspace-native-ops-routes.test.mjs
openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-evidence
observer-openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-evidence
```

## Deferred

The LSP lane still does not provide:

```text
long-lived connection reuse
workspace-wide open-file synchronization
language-server installation or dependency management
multi-request symbol navigation sessions
references/hover variant coverage for the same single-request path
Level 2 trusted session/work-view integration
Level 3 hostd/system daemon integration
```

## Follow-up Completed

The Observer control follow-up was completed as:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_OBSERVER_SYMBOL_REQUEST_CONTROL_PLAN.md
```

It lets the operator create the existing approval-gated symbol request task from
the LSP panel and inspect task/approval/completion readback without adding
another standalone evidence milestone.

## Route Correction

The historical next-step text for LSP references/hover variants is complete and
must not be selected again. The subsequent LSP chain now includes bounded
response summaries, references/hover variants, response target selection,
selected-target read/edit, verification handoff, recovery recommendation, and
recovered verification rerun.

The route then completed the native plugin refresh generation lifecycle and the
local Engineering Context Packet. The remaining ACPX live process boundary and
provider/model boundary require explicit operator authorization; autonomous work
must stay within already governed local capabilities until that authorization
exists.
