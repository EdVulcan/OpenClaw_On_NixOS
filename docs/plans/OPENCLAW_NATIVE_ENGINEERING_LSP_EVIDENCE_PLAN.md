# OpenClaw Native Engineering LSP Evidence Plan

Updated: 2026-07-09

## Active Slice

Native governed LSP availability and contract evidence for enhanced-source
`cc_lsp`.

This slice migrates the useful LSP contract shape into OpenClaw-native
workspace evidence. It does not start language servers, check server binaries,
open files in an LSP connection, send JSON-RPC requests, or import the enhanced
source implementation.

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Endpoint

```text
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-lsp/evidence

registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-evidence-v0
mode: lsp-contract-and-availability-evidence-only
```

Capability mapping:

```text
cc_lsp -> sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_evidence
```

## Implemented Behavior

The native builder:

```text
maps check / definition / references / hover action contracts
scans bounded workspace metadata for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python files
reports relevant config file presence without reading config bodies
reports server binary names, args, and install hints without executing checks
validates requested file position for future definition/references/hover calls
reports Observer-visible governance and deferred lifecycle boundaries
```

The endpoint is evidence-only. It returns response-embedded audit evidence and
does not persist a new record.

## Deferred

The following remain deferred:

```text
server binary version check outside the approval-gated lifecycle lane
long-lived LSP server process startup and pool state
file content read into LSP
textDocument/didOpen notification
definition / references / hover JSON-RPC request
language server pool lifecycle
task creation outside the approval-gated lifecycle lane
approval creation outside the approval-gated lifecycle lane
provider calls, network egress, result envelopes
```

Future LSP execution should continue through the governed workspace lifecycle
lane with explicit lifecycle state, failure evidence, Observer recovery
visibility, and boundaries before any long-lived process or JSON-RPC starts.

## Evidence

Runtime builder:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/native-engineering-lsp-evidence-builders.mjs
```

Route wiring:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/native-adapter-plugin-routes.mjs
```

Observer visibility:

```text
apps/observer-ui/src/observer-panels-operations.mjs
apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-renderers-engineering-lsp.mjs
```

Validation target:

```text
services/openclaw-core/test/native-engineering-lsp-evidence-builders.test.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/native-adapter-plugin-routes.test.mjs
openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-evidence
observer-openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-evidence
```

## Follow-Up Status

The recommended source write proposal follow-up was completed as:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_WRITE_PROPOSAL_PLAN.md
```

That slice migrates `cc_write` as redacted create/overwrite proposal evidence.
It still does not write files directly; approval-gated workspace text write
remains the authoritative mutation path.

The LSP lifecycle readiness follow-up was completed as:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_LIFECYCLE_READINESS_DRAFT_PLAN.md
```

That slice adds:

```text
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-lsp/lifecycle-draft
registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-draft-v0
mode: lsp-lifecycle-readiness-draft-only
```

It drafts a governed workspace-scoped language-server lifecycle action and
readiness gate list. Later lifecycle slices add approval-gated task execution,
binary checks, and a bounded process supervision probe while still blocking
long-lived lifecycle state persistence, source-file content reads, JSON-RPC,
provider calls, and network egress.

The LSP supervised lifecycle pilot follow-up was completed as:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SUPERVISED_LIFECYCLE_PILOT_PLAN.md
```

That slice adds:

```text
POST /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-lsp/lifecycle-tasks
task registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-task-v0
execution registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-execution-v0
mode: approval-gated-lsp-lifecycle-binary-gate
```

It creates an approval-gated task, proves pre-approval blocking and approved
binary-gate execution, records missing-binary recovery evidence, starts and
terminates a bounded user-space process supervision probe when a mapped server
binary exists, records explicit stop/restart lifecycle-state readback, and
exposes the workflow in Observer while still blocking source-content reads,
JSON-RPC, mutation, provider calls, and network egress.

The lifecycle-state follow-up was completed as:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_LIFECYCLE_STATE_PLAN.md
```

It adds `GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-lsp/lifecycle-state` for
read-only persisted state records across approved start/restart probes, explicit
stop actions, and recovery-required outcomes.
