# OpenClaw Native Engineering Context Provider Handoff Bridge Plan

Updated: 2026-07-16

## Active Slice

Explicitly approved provider consumption of the existing work-view observation
and plan/todo context bridges, including one bounded AI engineering-plan draft
that an operator can explicitly save to the existing workbench.

Identity alignment: Level 1 to Level 2 boundary, with provider egress still
owned by the existing approval-gated DeepSeek task.

## Demonstrated Gap

The local Engineering Context Packet could already report trusted work-view
capture freshness, frame provenance, semantic-target counts, and visible
plan/todo state. The approved provider materializer only assembled transcript,
verification, and recovery evidence, so an operator could not deliberately
include those newer summaries in the same bound request.

## Implemented Behavior

The existing `contextPacket` request may explicitly add:

```json
{
  "includeWorkView": true,
  "includeWorkViewObservation": true,
  "includePlanTodo": true
}
```

The provider materializer then:

```text
reads the authoritative session-manager state through the existing local route
derives the same compact work-view association and observation summary used by
the local packet
reuses the existing bounded plan/todo evidence builder
microcompacts the caller-owned packet while retaining protected evidence
materializes one bounded provider message in memory
includes the resulting content hash in the existing request binding check
returns only compact inclusion/status/hash evidence to durable task state
```

Observation metadata is provenance only. The provider message does not include
page URLs, page text, pixels, data URLs, semantic-target items, selectors,
input values, lease ids, credentials, or arbitrary endpoint data. Credential-like
patterns are redacted across task, transcript, work-view, and plan/todo message
text before the provider message is materialized.

`includeWorkViewObservation` without the explicit `includeWorkView` request is
rejected rather than silently ignored. The work-view read can still report an
unavailable local state; it does not invent authority or automatically recover
the helper.

## Governance

```text
explicit operator request and existing approved provider task required
context content remains transient in the current execution request
request and context hashes are rechecked before credential read or network send
no task, approval, action, plan transition, or todo-file mutation is automatic
no provider call occurs during local materialization
no credential-store read occurs during context assembly
recommendations remain review-only and use the existing allowlist
```

The new flags are part of the materialized request shape. Changing them changes
the provider request content hash and therefore fails the existing approval
binding instead of turning an approval for one context into approval for another.

The follow-up source-task binding is documented in
`OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_CONTEXT_PROVIDER_SOURCE_TASK_PLAN.md`. It keeps
the provider egress task id as the approval owner while allowing an explicit
existing engineering task to supply the bounded context. The source task must
exist, and both ids plus the materialized content hash are retained as compact
provenance.

The same handoff task is now exposed through the common capability runtime as:

```text
act.openclaw.engineering_context.provider_handoff_task
```

The capability requires an approved cross-boundary invocation and
`params.confirm=true`, validates the fixed DeepSeek credential reference and
bounded request envelope, then delegates to the existing egress task builder.
It accepts the compact source-task/context-hash binding but never stores the
request message, creates a second execution owner, reads credentials, or
contacts the provider. The later `/operator/step` binding check remains the
only path that can proceed toward execution.

Observer now exposes the same capability in the Engineering Context panel as a
one-shot pending-task control. The operator supplies a bounded transient
request and may explicitly select the existing Context Source Task ID, while
the panel returns only task, approval, binding, and governance readback. The
selected source id is forwarded into the same redacted request binding; the
control does not infer or mutate a source task, approve the task, run
`/operator/step`, display the request text, or contact DeepSeek.

## Engineering Plan Draft Follow-Up Complete

The existing handoff now accepts the bounded
`engineering_plan_v0` response contract. Its provider instruction requires a
JSON object containing only:

```text
planSummary: bounded text
todos: 1-8 bounded { id, description } objects
requiresOperatorReview: true
```

The contract rejects unknown keys, duplicate todo ids, paths, URLs,
credential-like values, and automatic task/approval/execution flags. Valid
results are returned only in the current operator response as `plan`; the live
provider task retains only compact contract evidence, todo count, summary
length, validity, and response hash. The plan and todo text are not written to
task state or the invocation ledger.

Observer adds an explicit response-mode selector and renders the transient plan
in the Engineering Context panel. `Save Reviewed AI Plan` revalidates the
contract and calls the existing
`act.openclaw.engineering_context.plan_todo_workbench_state` capability with
`confirm: true`, the existing source task id, and normalized pending todos. It
does not approve or execute the provider task, create another task, mutate task
status, or accept arbitrary provider instructions.

```

The tests prove explicit flag handling, local work-view read assembly, plan/todo
assembly, sensitive payload exclusion, compact durable evidence, the bounded
plan response parser, transient live plan projection, the explicit Observer
workbench save, the pending-task control, and the existing hash-bound live
execution path. The real Phase 63 Core check now also binds
`engineering_plan_v0` through the positive `approved:true` plus `confirm:true`
common-capability path without exposing the request text or contacting a
provider. The Observer test proves the explicit source-task input reaches the
capability request and the plan test proves reviewed save uses the existing
workbench capability.

## Deferred

```text
automatic provider calls
automatic use of provider recommendations
automatic persistence or execution of AI-generated plans
automatic capability approval or provider task execution
raw page or visual payload transfer
long-lived LSP or ACPX/Codex process execution
new provider routes or credential sources
desktop-wide capture, root work, and arbitrary endpoint execution
```

## Next Smallest Capability

Keep the plan draft transient until the operator explicitly saves it through the
existing workbench capability. The provider-plan slice is complete; the next
product route is the smallest Level 2 operator decision exposed by bounded
trusted-work-view evidence. Existing recovery owners must be reused, and no
provider schema, readiness marker, or automatic action should be added without
a new demonstrated gap.
