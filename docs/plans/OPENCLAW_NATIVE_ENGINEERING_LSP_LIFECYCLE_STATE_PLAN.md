# OpenClaw Native Engineering LSP Lifecycle State Plan

Updated: 2026-07-09

## Active Slice

Native governed LSP lifecycle state readback.

This slice extends the existing `cc_lsp` lifecycle lane with a persistent
OpenClaw state record for approved lifecycle tasks. It does not create a
long-lived language-server pool. Instead, it records approved start/restart
process probes, explicit stop actions, recovery-required failures, bounded
stdout/stderr summaries, and Observer-visible state transitions.

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Endpoint And Registries

```text
GET /plugins/native-adapter/engineering-lsp/lifecycle-state

state registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-state-v0
task registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-task-v0
execution registry: openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-execution-v0
mode: read-only-lsp-lifecycle-state-readback
```

Capability mapping:

```text
cc_lsp lifecycle state -> sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle_state
```

## Implemented Behavior

The state readback:

```text
persists one record per workspace/language lifecycle key
records approved start and restart process probes
records explicit stop actions without requiring a server binary
records missing-binary and process-start recovery states
stores bounded stdout/stderr previews and byte/truncation metadata
keeps long-lived process active=false after every current action
keeps JSON-RPC, source-content transfer, provider egress, and root/hostd false
exposes read-only lifecycle-state filters by workspacePath, language, and limit
adds Observer lifecycle-state status readback for LSP tasks
```

## Boundaries

The slice still explicitly blocks:

```text
long-lived language server process pool
JSON-RPC initialize / shutdown / textDocument requests
source-content transfer into a language server
definition / references / hover LSP responses
automatic install or PATH mutation
automatic approval, automatic operator step, and automatic recovery execution
root/system daemon/polkit work
provider calls and network egress
```

## Evidence

Runtime:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-state.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/native-engineering-lsp-lifecycle-tasks.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/runtime-state.mjs
```

Route and adapter visibility:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/native-adapter-plugin-routes.mjs
services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review.mjs
apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-runtime-engineering-loop-controls.mjs
```

Validation targets:

```text
services/openclaw-core/test/task-executor.test.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/native-adapter-plugin-routes.test.mjs
openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-evidence
observer-openclaw-native-engineering-lsp-evidence
```

The existing LSP evidence milestones now prove static LSP evidence, lifecycle
draft, approval-gated task creation, missing-binary recovery, bounded start
probe, explicit stop readback, restart readback, persisted lifecycle state,
Observer lifecycle-state tokens, and the continued absence of JSON-RPC and
source-content transfer.

## Next Slice

Do not add another standalone LSP readiness shell. The next meaningful LSP step
is a governed initialize/shutdown handshake probe in the same lifecycle lane:

```text
Native governed LSP initialize/shutdown handshake evidence
```

That follow-up should only send bounded protocol initialization and shutdown
messages to an approved short-lived server process. It must still avoid
`textDocument/didOpen`, source file content transfer, definition/references/hover
requests, long-lived process pools, provider egress, package installation, and
root/system daemon work.
