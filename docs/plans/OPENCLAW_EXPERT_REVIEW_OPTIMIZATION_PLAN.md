# OpenClaw Expert Review Optimization Plan

This plan tracks the optimization work required before returning to giant-file decoupling or normal phase development.

## Completion Rule

The expert review items are considered complete only when each item has code-level mitigation, local validation evidence, and milestone/check coverage where the item affects routine development.

## Status

| Area | Review Finding | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test lifecycle P0/T3 | `dev-down.sh` used global process killing and prevented parallel runs. | Complete | Commit `6a7fcf3`; `openclaw-service-lifecycle-scope` milestone. |
| Test batch reuse P0/T1 | Every selected milestone restarted the full service stack. | Partial, result-envelope lane plus core/Observer pair reuse complete | Commit `eff4beb`; `openclaw-live-provider-result-envelope-batch-reuse` milestone; `openclaw-core-observer-pair-batch-reuse` covers non-result-envelope core/Observer pairs. Broader multi-phase lane batching remains pending. |
| Task executor branch chain | Large independent task dispatch branches. | Already complete before this plan | `NON_RECOVERABLE_TASK_HANDLERS` registry is present in `services/openclaw-core/src/task-executor.mjs`. |
| Shared types runtime coupling C1 | `shared-types` owned plugin runtime `.mjs` logic. | Complete | Runtime moved to `packages/plugin-runtime`; old `shared-types` paths are compatibility re-export shims. |
| Shared type exports E3 | Domain type files were not exported. | Complete | `@openclaw/shared-types` now exposes `api`, `events`, `policy`, `screen`, `session`, `system`, and `task` type subpaths. |
| Duplicate policy/risk types C2 | Policy domain and risk literals were duplicated. | Complete | `packages/shared-types/src/policy.ts` is the single source for `OpenClawPolicyDomain`, `PolicyDomain`, and `OpenClawRisk`. |
| Event schema duplication C2 | `OpenClawEvent<T>` and `EventSchema` described the same event payload contract independently. | Complete | `EventSchema<T>` reuses `OpenClawEvent<T>` payload typing from shared-types. |
| Shared package engineering E3 | Shared packages lacked independent tsconfig/barrel/type declarations. | Complete | Shared package `tsconfig.json` files, barrel entries, and `shared-utils` declarations added. |
| Unit tests E2 | No focused unit tests existed for shared packages or services. | Partial, core policy service tests complete | Node built-in tests added for plugin runtime, shared-events, shared-utils, and `openclaw-core` policy evaluation. Broader service-layer unit tests remain pending for task execution, route handlers, and service clients. |
| Shared-client empty shell C5 | `shared-client` only exported tiny service constants. | Complete | `service-descriptors` now provides typed and runtime service ids, default ports, URL env vars, and resolver helpers; core and Observer consume the shared runtime descriptors for defaults. |
| Shared-events identity helper C5 | `createEventName` was a no-op identity function. | Complete | Runtime and typed event factory now validate names against `eventNames`. |
| Root package script redundancy E1/P2 | `package.json` had many hard-coded `dev:*check:unix` milestone scripts. | Complete | Root scripts reduced to one milestone runner plus stable lifecycle/smoke aliases; `dev-milestone-check.sh` accepts milestone names as npm args. |
| Shell helper duplication E4 | `post_json()` was copied across many scripts. | Complete | 257 local definitions migrated to `dev-openclaw-http-json-helper.sh`; helper mode compatibility covered by `openclaw-http-json-helper`. |
| Observer mirror test duplication T2 | Observer checks duplicate core setup. | Partial, reusable pair runner complete | Result-envelope batch milestone covers core and Observer in one live service lifecycle; `dev-openclaw-core-observer-pair-runner.sh` lets compatible core/Observer pairs reuse one service lifecycle while preserving real Observer HTML/client checks. Legacy standalone Observer scripts remain for compatibility. |
| Fixed sleeps T4 | Scripts use fixed sleeps instead of polling. | Complete | `dev-openclaw-wait-helper.sh` replaces fixed numeric sleeps with bounded polling; audit has no `sleep N` matches under `nix/scripts`; `openclaw-wait-helper` and `@changed` passed. |
| State reuse P1/T5 | Heavy prerequisite chains are replayed. | Partial | Fast prerequisite helper exists for live-provider result-envelope chain; broader coverage pending. |

## Current Slice Exit Evidence

- `OPENCLAW_MILESTONE_CHECKS=openclaw-shared-package-contracts bash nix/scripts/dev-milestone-check.sh` passed.
- `OPENCLAW_MILESTONE_CHECKS=@changed bash nix/scripts/dev-milestone-check.sh` passed and selected only static/shared contract checks for this slice.
- `npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present` passed inside a dev shell with TypeScript.
- `npm run build --workspaces --if-present` passed inside a dev shell with TypeScript.
- `npm run test --workspaces --if-present` passed inside a dev shell with TypeScript.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## Package Script Reduction Evidence

- Root `package.json` scripts reduced from 229 entries to 14 entries.
- Unix check aliases reduced to `dev:state-check:unix`, `dev:command-capture-check:unix`, and `dev:milestone-check:unix`.
- `npm run dev:milestone-check:unix -- openclaw-shared-package-contracts` passed, proving argument-based milestone selection.
- `OPENCLAW_MILESTONE_CHECKS=@changed bash nix/scripts/dev-milestone-check.sh` passed and selected only static/shared checks for the script reduction slice.
- `npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present`, `npm run build --workspaces --if-present`, `npm run test --workspaces --if-present`, and `git diff --check` passed.

## Shell HTTP Helper Evidence

- Local `post_json()` helper definitions reduced to the single shared definition in `nix/scripts/dev-openclaw-http-json-helper.sh`.
- The helper preserves default fail, `-d`, no-fail, fail-with-body, and file upload modes through explicit per-script configuration.
- `OPENCLAW_MILESTONE_CHECKS=openclaw-http-json-helper bash nix/scripts/dev-milestone-check.sh` passed.
- `OPENCLAW_MILESTONE_CHECKS=@changed bash nix/scripts/dev-milestone-check.sh` passed and selected `task-workbench` as the representative real service check for the mechanical extraction.
- `bash -n` passed for all changed shell scripts.

## Wait Helper Evidence

- Fixed numeric sleeps in `nix/scripts/*.sh` were replaced with bounded polling via `nix/scripts/dev-openclaw-wait-helper.sh`.
- `rg -n '\bsleep [0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?\b' nix/scripts -g '*.sh'` returned no matches.
- `OPENCLAW_MILESTONE_CHECKS=openclaw-wait-helper bash nix/scripts/dev-milestone-check.sh` passed.
- `OPENCLAW_MILESTONE_CHECKS=@changed bash nix/scripts/dev-milestone-check.sh` passed and selected structural checks plus representative real service checks: `openclaw-service-lifecycle-scope`, `openclaw-live-provider-result-envelope-batch-reuse`, `state-settling`, `openclaw-ai-work-view-capture`, and `openclaw-workspace-command-hardening`.
- `bash -n` passed for all changed shell scripts and `git diff --check` passed.

## Core/Observer Pair Reuse Evidence

- `dev-openclaw-core-observer-pair-runner.sh` runs a compatible common-check once for core behavior and once for Observer HTML/client tokens while reusing the same live service lifecycle.
- `openclaw-core-observer-pair-batch-reuse` covers Phase 59 and Phase 60 cloud-consciousness launch/credential-gate pairs outside the result-envelope lane.
- The pair runner preserves existing public core and Observer milestone scripts; it adds a faster co-validation path without deleting compatibility wrappers.

## Core Service Unit Test Evidence

- `services/openclaw-core` now has a workspace `test` script using Node's built-in test runner.
- `policy-evaluator.test.mjs` covers cross-boundary approval gating, body-internal audit-only decisions, absolute deny boundaries, audit log capping/counts, and task approval creation without starting dev services.
- `openclaw-core-service-unit-tests` runs the focused service-layer unit tests as a milestone.

## Shared Client Runtime Descriptor Evidence

- `shared-client` now exposes runtime `.mjs` service descriptors plus `.d.ts` declarations and Node unit tests.
- `openclaw-core` and `observer-ui` use shared descriptor helpers for service default ports and URLs while preserving the existing environment variable names.
- `openclaw-shared-package-contracts` checks the shared-client runtime modules and tests.

## Next Expert Items After This Slice

1. Broaden safe state reuse for heavy prerequisite chains beyond the existing live-provider result-envelope path.
2. Add more service-layer unit tests for task execution, route handler contract helpers, and service clients.
3. Move shared-events names into real service/Observer publish call sites where doing so reduces duplicated event contracts.
