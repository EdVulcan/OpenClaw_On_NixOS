# OpenClaw Coupling Reduction Plan

Created after Phase 116. Updated after the first live-provider runtime
extraction slices and milestone registry/audit slices.

## Audit Policy

Line count is no longer a decision metric.

The project should reduce files and workflows that bundle unrelated
responsibilities, require repeated hand synchronization, or make one small
feature touch many stateful surfaces. A large cohesive domain module can be
acceptable temporarily. A smaller file should still be split when it mixes
route dispatch, state mutation, approval logic, UI ids, validation fixtures, or
milestone orchestration.

Primary coupling signals:

- Mixed responsibilities in one module.
- Hand-synchronized tokens across core routes, runtime builders, task
  executors, Observer panels, DOM selectors, refreshers, startup timers, and
  milestone scripts.
- State, approval, event, and persistence operations interleaved with route or
  presentation code.
- Recursive milestone checks that rebuild long prerequisite chains when an
  artifact could prove the prerequisite safely.
- Changes that require broad validation because ownership boundaries are not
  explicit.

Audit sources used for this revision:

- Core static scan and read-only subagent audit of `services/openclaw-core` and
  shared packages.
- Observer UI static scan and read-only subagent audit of HTML, DOM selectors,
  refreshers, runtime actions, and startup polling.
- `nix/scripts` and docs read-only subagent audit of recursive common-checks,
  artifact naming, observer/core drift, and milestone registry coupling.

## Completed Coupling Work

1. Extracted live-provider governance helpers from
   `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-live-provider-runtime-implementation.mjs`.
2. Extracted Phase 115-116 local-read task shell runtime into a focused module.
3. Extracted Phase 111-114 result-envelope creation execution attempt runtime
   into a focused module.
4. Extracted Phase 107-110 result-envelope creation execution runtime into a
   focused module.
5. Extracted Phase 103-106 result-envelope creation runtime into a focused
   module.
6. Externalized the milestone runner registry into
   `nix/scripts/dev-milestone-checks.tsv` with registry validation and
   `@changed` affected-check selection.
7. Added a milestone script taxonomy audit for script counts, registry
   coverage, long filename pressure, and unregistered non-common check scripts.
8. Added a Phase 99-116 live-provider result-envelope milestone manifest that
   statically proves registry rows, phase plans, core wrappers, Observer
   wrappers, and common checks still align with one metadata source.
9. Replaced the 36 Phase 99-116 core/Observer wrapper bodies with a shared
   manifest-driven wrapper helper while preserving every public script filename
   and registry entry.
10. Extended the Phase 99-116 manifest check to derive each phase primary
    registry and verify the repeated common-check registry inputs.
11. Extended the same manifest check to derive and verify the repeated
    route/approved/final-readiness/task-shell status markers in common checks.
12. Extended the manifest check to derive and verify the repeated Phase 99-116
    core/system-heal state artifact filenames in common checks.
13. Extracted the repeated Phase 99-116 common-check environment setup into a
    manifest-driven helper for ports, plan docs, state artifacts, and core /
    Observer URLs.
14. Extracted the repeated Phase 99-116 fast prerequisite reuse setup into a
    bounded helper while preserving each milestone's local service assertions
    and fallback predecessor script.
15. Replaced the hand-written Phase 99-116 core / Observer milestone registry
    rows with manifest-generated registry directives, preserving public check
    names while reducing duplicated TSV wiring.
16. Scoped Unix dev service lifecycle state by explicit run id while preserving
    default legacy state / pid / log compatibility, enabling parallel and batch
    validation without global process killing.
17. Added a Phase 99-102 result-envelope batch validation lane that starts one
    scoped service stack and reuses it across adjacent core and Observer checks.
18. Confirmed `task-executor.mjs` now uses a `NON_RECOVERABLE_TASK_HANDLERS`
    predicate/handler registry instead of the previous long task branch chain.
19. Extracted the Phase 99-115 result-envelope GET route cluster from
    `route-handlers.mjs` into a focused route group module while preserving all
    public endpoint paths and builder names.
20. Extracted the live-provider credential POST route cluster from
    `route-handlers.mjs` into a focused table-driven route group module. The
    main router now delegates these public POST endpoints through one cohesive
    handler while preserving confirm parsing, task / approval serialization,
    raw preflight task envelopes, and response status codes.
21. Extracted the earlier live-provider task / preflight POST route cluster
    into a second focused route group. Both live-provider POST groups now share
    a small confirm-POST response-envelope helper so future route extraction
    does not copy error handling, `{ confirm }` parsing, task serialization, or
    approval serialization.
22. Extracted the Observer/core read-model GET route cluster for capabilities,
    capability invocation history, command transcripts, filesystem changes, and
    filesystem reads into a focused read-only route group. The main router keeps
    mutable capability refresh/invoke routes local while the extracted module
    preserves public endpoint paths, limit semantics, summary serializers, and
    response status codes.
23. Extracted the approval inbox/action route family from the main router into
    a focused approval route module. The module owns `/approvals`,
    `/approvals/summary`, `/approvals/:id/approve`, and `/approvals/:id/deny`
    while preserving status filtering, limit clamping, default actor/reason
    text, approval events, denied-task failure events, task serialization, and
    response status codes.
24. Extracted the operator/control route family into a focused autonomous
    control module. The module owns `/operator/state`, `/operator/step`,
    `/operator/run`, `/control/pause`, `/control/resume`, `/control/takeover`,
    and `/control/stop` while preserving operator loop response shapes, task
    serialization, runtime state responses, phase updates, takeover metadata,
    and task lifecycle events.
25. Extracted the task read/lifecycle route family into a focused task route
    module. The module owns task summary/active/focus/list/detail endpoints,
    task creation, planning, planned execution, direct execution, recovery,
    phase updates, work-view attachment, and completion while preserving task
    events, approval publication hooks, default task input values, recovery
    conflict semantics, execution serialization, and runtime state responses.
26. Extracted the system/body/memory/cloud task POST cluster into a table-driven
    domain task route module. The module owns systemd repair task creation,
    body evidence ledger task shells and append arming, long-term memory write
    task creation, and early cloud-consciousness handoff/provider task shells
    while preserving per-route input shaping, 200/201 status codes, task and
    approval serialization, route-specific evidence fields, and task summaries.
27. Extracted the read-only workspace and plugin review route family into a
    focused workspace/plugin read route module. The module owns workspace
    registry summaries, command proposal read models, OpenClaw migration and
    plugin SDK review routes, tool catalog/manifest-map read models, native
    plugin contract/registry/readiness routes, and their summary projections
    while preserving public paths, query aliases, response field selection, and
    existing 400 error contracts.
28. Extracted the workspace-native operations route family into a focused route
    module. The module owns native workspace text-write, patch-apply,
    source-authored edit, workspace command, and source command draft/task
    routes while preserving draft plan serialization, JSON query parsing,
    strict confirmation handling, 200/201 success codes, 400/404 error
    contracts, serialized task/approval envelopes, and task summaries.
29. Extracted the native-adapter plugin/profile/search-web/workspace-index
    route family into a focused route module. The module owns plugin profile
    and tool catalog readbacks, search-web adapter plans/preflights/sandbox
    readbacks, their approval-gated task creation routes, workspace semantic
    index and symbol lookup routes, and prompt semantics while preserving query
    aliases, limit parsing, 400/404 error contracts, task and approval
    serialization, and public endpoint paths.
30. Extracted the generic native-plugin invocation/runtime route family into a
    focused plan-builder-backed route module. The module owns invoke plans,
    runtime preflight and activation plan readbacks, runtime adapter contracts
    and task drafts, and the invoke/runtime-adapter/runtime-activation task
    creation routes while preserving default capability IDs, the invoke-plan
    response wrapper and 404 error contract, runtime 400 error contracts,
    strict confirmation parsing, route-specific response fields, task/approval
    serialization, governance fields, and task summaries.
31. Extracted the policy/capability mutation route family into a focused
    governance route module. The module owns policy state/evaluation,
    capability registry refresh, and capability invocation while preserving
    event names and payloads, policy evaluation stage strings, direct
    invocation status passthrough, local 400 error envelopes, and the refresh
    response shape.
32. Extracted the MVP, Phase 2-6, and long-term-memory read-only route family
    into a focused phase/memory read-model module. The module owns the early
    phase planning/readiness/exit endpoints and local long-term-memory
    readbacks while preserving public paths, the Phase 2 route-review query
    flags, direct response bodies, and server-level error handling.
33. Extracted the cloud-consciousness read-only GET route cluster into a
    focused route module. The module owns the local handoff, provider adapter,
    real-provider rehearsal, live-provider runbook/execution/runtime,
    real-launch, and credential-value local-read ladder readbacks while keeping
    result-envelope GET routes and POST/task routes in their existing focused
    modules.
34. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` capability registry/invocation boundary
    into `services/openclaw-core/src/capability-runtime.mjs` and
    `services/openclaw-core/src/capability-descriptors.mjs`. The descriptor
    module owns local body capability metadata, while the runtime module owns
    service health probing, capability policy inputs, backend dispatch, result
    summaries, invocation history, and capability invocation events while
    preserving the existing plan-builder public method names used by routes
    and task execution.
35. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` systemd repair task builders and body
    evidence ledger task-shell builders into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/systemd-task-builders.mjs` and
    `services/openclaw-core/src/body-evidence-task-builders.mjs`. The split
    preserves the public plan-builder method names used by the main router and
    domain task POST routes while keeping systemd repair materialization
    separate from body evidence ledger task-shell materialization.
36. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 7 long-term memory builder lane into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/long-term-memory-builders.mjs`. The module owns
    the local JSONL write plan, schema, proposal, route review, task shell,
    approved append executor, readback, and exit gate while injecting only the
    Phase 6 read-model builders and task lifecycle helpers it needs.
37. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 8 cloud-consciousness local handoff
    lane into `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-consciousness-handoff-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns local context review, handoff schema/package/redaction,
    transmission route review, task shell, approved local handoff append,
    readback, and exit while keeping real provider adapters and later provider
    dry-run/egress lanes in `plan-builder.mjs`.
38. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 9 cloud-consciousness provider
    adapter dry-run lane into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-consciousness-provider-dry-run-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns the provider adapter plan/contract/request envelope,
    dry-run route review, task shell, approved local dry-run transcript,
    readback, and exit while leaving real provider-call rehearsal/live-provider
    lanes in `plan-builder.mjs`.
39. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 10 cloud-consciousness provider-call
    rehearsal lane into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-consciousness-provider-call-rehearsal-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns the real-call preflight plan, egress contract, credential
    preflight, request redaction review, route review, approval-gated rehearsal
    task, local response readback, and exit while leaving live-provider runbook
    and later egress lanes in `plan-builder.mjs`.
40. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 11 cloud-consciousness live-provider
    runbook lane into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-consciousness-live-provider-runbook-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns the live-provider runbook plan, operator checklist, egress
    transcript schema, final authorization review, runbook route review,
    approval-gated runbook task, readback, and exit while leaving Phase 12
    execution-plan and later runtime-adapter lanes in `plan-builder.mjs`.
41. Split the shared task-builder test harness into
    `services/openclaw-core/test/task-builder-harness.mjs` so new extracted
    builder-lane tests do not keep growing one large test file.
42. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 12 cloud-consciousness live-provider
    execution-plan lane into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-consciousness-live-provider-execution-plan-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns the execution plan, endpoint/credential metadata binding,
    execution transcript schema, route review, approval-gated execution-plan
    task, readback, exit, and shared Phase 12 evidence projection used by later
    live-provider phases.
43. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 13-17 cloud-consciousness live-provider
    runtime-readiness lane into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-consciousness-live-provider-runtime-readiness-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns the runtime-adapter plan and approval-gated task shell,
    final authorization and operator launch review read models, and the runtime
    implementation plan bridge while preserving live egress, credential value
    reads, provider SDK loading, and endpoint contact as disabled/deferred.
44. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` native plugin planning/runtime shell lane
    into `services/openclaw-core/src/native-plugin-plan-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns native capability invoke plans, runtime preflight,
    activation plans, adapter contracts, task drafts, and approval-gated native
    plugin invoke/runtime task shells while preserving the public plan-builder
    method names used by native plugin runtime routes.
45. Extracted the early `cloud-live-provider-runtime-implementation.mjs`
    runtime task lanes into focused modules:
    `cloud-live-provider-runtime-initial-builders.mjs` owns Phase 18-29
    runtime implementation, adapter implementation/module, and request-builder
    task shells; `cloud-live-provider-runtime-credential-reference-builders.mjs`
    owns Phase 32-37 credential-reference resolver and no-network sender task

    owns Phase 79-86 credential-value local-read route/task shell,
    approved-deferred readback, final readiness preflight, local-read execution
    route/task shell, execution approved-deferred readback, execution final
    readiness preflight, and both approval-gated executors. The main runtime
    implementation now
    composes those factories while preserving public method names, registry
    strings, endpoint behavior, approval gates, event publication, persistence
    calls, task predicates, and deferred executor summaries.
46. Extracted the `cloud-live-provider-runtime-implementation.mjs` Phase 87-90
    credential-value local-read execution-local-read lane into
    `cloud-live-provider-runtime-credential-value-local-read-execution-local-read-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns the execution-local-read route, approval-gated task shell,
    approved-deferred readback, final readiness preflight recording, and
    approval-gated executor while preserving public runtime method names,
    registry strings, deferred credential-value-read semantics, event
    publication, persistence calls, and task predicates.
47. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` body-evidence follow-up readiness lane
    into `services/openclaw-core/src/body-evidence-readiness-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns follow-up ledger task lookup, durable JSONL readback,
    follow-up task readiness, append route review, explicit append arming, and
    append-readiness read models while preserving the public plan-builder
    method names used by Phase 2 read routes, task routes, and milestone
    assertions.
48. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 4 conservative self-heal read-model
    family into `services/openclaw-core/src/phase4-self-heal-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns Phase 4 route selection, system-sense/system-heal evidence
    reads, self-heal loop evidence, heal/maintenance history packaging,

    plan-builder method names, registry strings, read-only governance, and
    route contracts.
49. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 3 work-view and operator-interrupt
    read-model family into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/phase3-work-view-builders.mjs`. The module
    owns Phase 3 route selection, session-manager work-view state readback,
    background work-view evidence, pause/resume/stop/takeover control
    readiness, completion readiness, and exit while preserving all Phase 3
    public plan-builder method names, registry strings, non-intrusive
    governance, and route contracts.
50. Extracted the `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 5/MVP/Post-MVP/Phase 6 read-only
    evidence chain into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/phase5-mvp-phase6-readiness-builders.mjs`.
    The module owns deployment inventory, rollback readiness, release control,
    MVP final readiness, post-MVP route selection, Phase 6 memory substrate
    inventory, consciousness context envelopes, task orchestration records,
    memory-write route review, and Phase 6 exit while preserving all public
    plan-builder method names, registry strings, route contracts, and the
    `buildPhase6Exit` / `buildPhase6ConsciousnessContextEnvelope` dependency
    names used by the long-term-memory and cloud handoff lanes.
51. Extracted the capability-aware rule-plan helper cluster into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/rule-plan-builders.mjs`. The module owns
    public plan redaction, rule-plan action normalization, planner intent
    inference, capability annotation, capability summary generation, plan-build
    selection, and plan phase updates while preserving the public
    `serialisePlanForPublic`, `buildRulePlan`, `shouldBuildPlan`, and

    handlers, workspace operations, and task executors.
52. Extracted the Phase 2/MVP legacy read-model family into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/phase2-mvp-readiness-builders.mjs`. The module
    owns MVP route alignment, repair demo status, next repair demo status,
    Phase 2 demo control room, walkthrough, demo readiness exit, next
    capability route review, Phase 2 completion readiness, and Phase 2 exit
    while preserving the public method names and the body-evidence readiness
    route-review dependency through a lazy wrapper in `plan-builder.mjs`.
53. Extracted the `plugin-review.mjs` workspace/source intake surface into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-workspace-discovery.mjs`,
    `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-source-command-proposals.mjs`,
    and `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-source-migration.mjs`.
    These modules now own read-only workspace detection, package-manager and
    script command proposals, source-command signal composition, and
    migration candidate/plan projections while preserving the public plugin
    review method names, registry strings, no-execution governance, and
    workspace plugin read-route contracts.
54. Extracted the `plugin-review.mjs` Plugin SDK contract/source/native-contract
    lane into `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-sdk-contracts.mjs` and
    moved shared object-key sorting into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-common.mjs`. The SDK module now
    owns plugin SDK contract review, source review scope, derived source-content
    signals, native contract tests, native SDK contract implementation slots,
    native contract/registry envelopes, and reviewed package selection while
    preserving public plugin review method names, route contracts, native
    registry strings, and no-import/no-execution governance.
55. Extracted the `plugin-review.mjs` manifest/capability planning lane into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-manifest-capability.mjs`. The
    module now owns native plugin manifest profile, extension manifest map,
    manifest-derived capability plan, and candidate contract tests while

    strings, metadata-only privacy boundaries, and no-runtime-activation
    governance.
56. Extracted the `plugin-review.mjs` search-web task materializer into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-search-web-tasks.mjs`. The module
    owns approval-gated task creation for search-web adapter invocation,
    runtime activation, and provider runtime sandbox shells while preserving
    public method names, task types, registry strings, lifecycle event
    publication, approval creation, persistence calls, and no-network/no-runtime
    execution governance.
57. Extracted the `plugin-review.mjs` search-web read-model/planning lane into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-search-web-plans.mjs`. The module
    owns provider contract shells, provider selection, approval-gated task
    drafts, runtime preflight envelopes, activation gates, and provider runtime
    sandbox contracts while preserving public method names, native search/web
    registry strings, query redaction, no-network/no-import/no-runtime
    activation boundaries, and explicit approval task-draft semantics.
58. Extracted the `plugin-review.mjs` workspace intelligence surfaces into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review-workspace-intelligence.mjs`. The
    module owns OpenClaw workspace selection, tool catalog metadata, native tool
    catalog profile filtering, prompt semantics, semantic index, symbol lookup,
    and edit-target selection while preserving public method names, read-only
    metadata/source-derived outputs, bounded declaration previews, and no
    source-body/no-import/no-execution governance.
59. Split the Observer runtime action script by extracting runtime/system/body
    and systemd refreshers from
    `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-runtime-actions.mjs` into
    `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-refreshers-runtime.mjs`. The served
    client script remains byte-for-byte identical through `clientScript()`
    assembly while the action file now owns event streams, button actions,
    task/work-view control helpers, and task card event delegation only.
60. Extracted task recovery classification and recovered-task creation from
    `services/openclaw-core/src/task-manager.mjs` into
    `services/openclaw-core/src/task-recovery.mjs`. The module now owns
    operator-capability recovery predicates, native runtime/search-web deferred
    task classifiers, eye-hand recovery evidence, policy/plan reset, and
    recovered task creation while `task-manager.mjs` and `task-executor.mjs`
    share the same source of truth for restorable/deferred recovery semantics.
61. Split the Observer cloud refresher script by extracting
    `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-refreshers-cloud-context.mjs`,
    `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-refreshers-cloud-live-runbook.mjs`,
    `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-refreshers-cloud-live-launch.mjs`,
    `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-refreshers-cloud-live-local-read.mjs`,
    and
    `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-refreshers-cloud-live-result-envelope.mjs`.
    The public `observerClientCloudRefreshersScript` export now only assembles
    phase-family chunks, and `clientScript()` was proven byte-for-byte identical
    after the split, preserving every global refresh function, DOM id, endpoint,
    registry token, and startup-visible symbol.
62. Extracted bounded local filesystem operations from
    `services/openclaw-system-sense/src/server.mjs` into
    `services/openclaw-system-sense/src/system-file-operations.mjs`. The module
    now owns allowed-root boundary checks, file metadata/list/search/read,
    bounded text write/append, and directory creation while the HTTP server
    keeps the existing `/system/files/*` routes, event names, response fields,
    error codes, and body-sovereign local filesystem semantics.
63. Replaced Observer startup refresh double-entry wiring with
    `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-startup-refreshes.mjs`. The startup
    entrypoint now renders initial `await refresh...()` calls and matching
    `setInterval(..., 5000)` registrations from one grouped descriptor list of
    247 refresh names while preserving the one-shot event hooks and proving
    `clientScript()` byte-for-byte identical.

These slices reduced live-provider runtime and milestone orchestration coupling
while preserving the public runtime API and existing milestone entry names.

## High-Coupling Hotspots

| Priority | Area | Coupling Evidence | Safe First Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | `nix/scripts` late credential-value/result-envelope phase chain | Phase number, slug, predecessor, artifact path, registry, status marker, docs token, observer token, endpoint, and `next.recommendedSlice` are repeated across the Phase 99-116 chain. Partial fast-prereq reuse means validation speed and evidence quality depend on per-script string wiring. | Introduce a metadata table for Phases 99-116 and keep existing scripts as shims. First proof should statically compare metadata to current script/doc strings, then run representative phases 100, 108, and 116 in full and fast modes. |
| P0 | `services/openclaw-core/src/route-handlers.mjs` | Core HTTP dispatch, proxying, phase route mapping, plugin routes, task POST routes, approval surfaces, and workspace/body routes are all in one request chain. Route tokens must be hand-synced with runtime exports, Observer refreshers, and milestone scripts. Phase 99-115 result-envelope GET routes, both live-provider POST route groups, the Observer/core read-model GET routes, approval inbox/action routes, operator/control routes, task read/lifecycle routes, system/body/memory/cloud task POST routes, read-only workspace/plugin review routes, workspace-native operation routes, native-adapter plugin/profile/search-web/workspace-index routes, generic native-plugin invocation/runtime task routes, policy/capability mutation routes, MVP/Phase 2-6/long-term-memory read routes, and cloud-consciousness read-only GET routes are now grouped. Only proxy/health and systemd draft routes still live directly in the main chain. | Continue route group extraction while keeping `registerRoutes(deps)` stable. Next cohesive targets are the small proxy/health/systemd draft surfaces, then move to larger P1 hotspots such as `plan-builder.mjs`, Observer startup descriptors, and `plugin-review.mjs`. |
| P0 | `services/openclaw-core/src/task-executor.mjs` | Execution dispatch still imports many `is...Task`/`execute...Task` pairs, but task matching now uses a `NON_RECOVERABLE_TASK_HANDLERS` registry instead of an ordered if/else branch chain. Remaining coupling is the broad import/destructure surface and mixed local executor domains. | Deprioritize branch-chain work; next improvement should split handler groups only when moving a cohesive domain and preserving the registry entry order. |
| P0 | Observer UI startup and panel synchronization (`client-script-startup.mjs`, `client-script-startup-refreshes.mjs`, `server.mjs`, `client-script-config-dom.mjs`) | Startup initial refresh calls and polling intervals are generated from one grouped descriptor list, so adding one panel no longer requires synchronized edits to both startup sequences. Remaining coupling is HTML ids, DOM constants, refresh function implementation, and milestone token checks still being manually coordinated. | Add grouped DOM descriptors for one cloud or system/body lane while preserving legacy aliases and served `/client.js` token compatibility. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-core/src/plan-builder.mjs` | The file is now mostly a composition root plus operator state, task lifecycle helpers, capability runtime wiring, and extracted factory wiring. The Phase 2/MVP legacy read-model family, capability-aware rule-plan helper cluster, native plugin planning/runtime shell lane, capability registry/invocation slice, systemd/body task-shell builders, body-evidence follow-up readiness lane, Phase 3 work-view read-model family, Phase 4 self-heal read-model family, Phase 5/MVP/Post-MVP/Phase 6 read-only evidence chain, Phase 7 long-term memory lane, Phase 8 cloud handoff lane, Phase 9 provider dry-run lane, Phase 10 provider-call rehearsal lane, Phase 11 live-provider runbook lane, Phase 12 live-provider execution-plan lane, and Phase 13-17 live-provider runtime-readiness lane are now extracted. | Deprioritize as a large-file hotspot unless task lifecycle helpers grow again; next higher-ROI core hotspots are `plugin-review.mjs`, `cloud-live-provider-runtime-implementation.mjs` Phase 91+ composition, `route-handlers.mjs` residual proxy/health/systemd draft surfaces, and `task-manager.mjs` serialization descriptors. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-live-provider-runtime-implementation.mjs` | Now mostly composes extracted live-provider runtime lanes, but still has a broad dependency/destructure surface and Phase 91+ attempt/result-envelope factory composition. The Phase 18-29, Phase 32-37, Phase 40-48, Phase 52-55, Phase 56-59, Phase 60-64, Phase 65-70, Phase 71-78, Phase 79-86, and Phase 87-90 runtime lanes are now extracted into focused factories. | Continue lane extraction only where it removes cross-phase coupling. Next cohesive target is the Phase 91+ local-read attempt and result-envelope composition surface; separately consider an approved-deferred lifecycle helper that preserves status strings. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-system-sense/src/server.mjs` | Bounded filesystem operations are extracted into `system-file-operations.mjs`, but the server still owns command execution, process listing, service discovery, health trends, route-aware recommendations, systemd inventory/dependency maps, and body evidence route reviews. | Continue extracting system-sense domain modules behind stable endpoints: command/process ops, health/systemd sensing, body-evidence route builders. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review.mjs` | Now a small composition surface for workspace/source intake, source migration, source command proposals, SDK contracts, manifest/capability planning, search-web planning/tasks, workspace intelligence, formal readiness, and native adapter status. The high-coupling workspace tool catalog/prompt/semantic/symbol/edit-target logic is extracted. | Treat as largely reduced; only split formal readiness/native adapter status if those status summaries start growing again. Next higher-ROI core hotspots are `cloud-live-provider-runtime-implementation.mjs`, `route-handlers.mjs`, and `task-manager.mjs`. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-core/src/task-manager.mjs` | Task recovery predicates, recovered-plan reset, and recovered-task creation are now extracted into `task-recovery.mjs` and shared by `task-executor.mjs`. Remaining coupling is task serialization manually knowing domain-specific extension fields plus lifecycle/persistence helpers. | Add a local `TASK_EXTENSION_FIELDS` descriptor used by serialization and creation while preserving today's top-level output keys. |
| P1 | `nix/scripts` milestone script taxonomy | The runner registry is externalized, but common/core/observer scripts still grow by hand and include long filenames, unregistered helper checks, and repeated shell wiring. | Use the `milestone-script-audit` artifact as the baseline, then add metadata-generated shims for the repeated Phase 99-116 live-provider chain before deleting or renaming legacy scripts. |
| P2 | `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-runtime-actions.mjs` | Runtime/system/body/systemd refreshers are extracted into `client-script-refreshers-runtime.mjs`, and the served client script was proven byte-for-byte identical after assembly. Remaining coupling is action/button registration, event stream refresh fan-out, task focus state, work-view helpers, and repeated post-action refresh sequences. | Extract event-to-refresh and button-action descriptor tables while preserving global function names and byte-for-byte or token-equivalent served output where feasible. |
| P2 | `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-refreshers-cloud.mjs` | Cloud/live-provider refreshers are now split into context/provider rehearsal, live runbook/runtime adapter, real launch/credential authorization, local-read, and result-envelope chunks, and startup refresh registration is descriptor-backed. Remaining coupling is the repeated endpoint-to-DOM rendering pattern inside each phase-family chunk. | Introduce descriptor-backed endpoint/DOM rendering for one cloud lane only after preserving global function names and served `/client.js` token compatibility. |
| P2 | `services/openclaw-core/src/workspace-ops.mjs` | Target resolution, patch parsing, diff preview, proposals, source-derived proposals, policy metadata, task creation, approval, and event publication share one operational surface. | Split pure patch/diff/proposal builders from task materializers. Keep registry strings and task payload shape unchanged. |
| P2 | Shared plugin contract (`packages/shared-types/src/plugin-registry.mjs`, `plugin-contract.mjs`) | Native capability IDs and validators are small but drive plan-builder capability mapping, plugin review, workspace ops, route behavior, executor handling, and milestone assertions. | Move capability descriptors into a data module while preserving `createOpenClawNativePluginRegistry` and exact capability IDs. |

## Deprioritized By Coupling

- Long docs are not refactor targets unless they cause process drift.
- Files under any line threshold are not automatically acceptable.
- Files over any line threshold are not automatically bad when they own one
  cohesive domain and have stable validation.

## Refactor Order

1. Finish reducing active live-provider lane coupling while it remains the
   current development surface.
2. Use the active credential/result-envelope manifest to extract repeated
   assertion helpers so validation no longer depends on hand-repeated docs,
   Observer, and state JSON assertions.
3. Continue splitting `route-handlers.mjs` by domain so future phases do not
   keep editing one router chain.
4. Split `task-executor.mjs` handler groups only after the current route
   extraction work, since the global branch chain has already been replaced by
   a registry table.
5. Add Observer startup/panel/selector descriptors to stop HTML/DOM/refresher/startup
   drift.
6. Add broader milestone phase descriptors and shared assertion helpers to reduce slow,
   recursive, hand-written validation scripts.
7. Continue splitting remaining `plan-builder.mjs` Phase 3-6 read-model
   families, `plugin-review.mjs`, and `openclaw-system-sense` after the active
   provider lane no longer forces changes through the current monoliths.

## Minimum Proof For Each Slice

- The extracted boundary has one clear responsibility.
- Public entry points remain stable or are explicitly shimmed.
- No new replacement module bundles unrelated domains.
- `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass for JavaScript changes.
- A focused milestone or regression check exercises the moved behavior.
- Validation notes state whether fast prerequisite reuse or full-chain
  validation was used.
