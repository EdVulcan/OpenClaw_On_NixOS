# OpenClaw Coupling Reduction Plan

Created after Phase 116. Updated after the first live-provider runtime
extraction slices and milestone registry/audit slices.

## Audit Policy

Line count is no longer a decision metric.

The project should reduce files and workflows that bundle unrelated
responsibilities, require repeated hand synchronization, or make one small
feature touch many stateful surfaces. A large cohesive domain module can be
acceptable temporarily. A smaller file should still be split when it mixes
route dispatch, state mutation, approval logic, UI ids, validation fixtures, or
milestone orchestration.

Primary coupling signals:

- Mixed responsibilities in one module.
- Hand-synchronized tokens across core routes, runtime builders, task
  executors, Observer panels, DOM selectors, refreshers, startup timers, and
  milestone scripts.
- State, approval, event, and persistence operations interleaved with route or
  presentation code.
- Recursive milestone checks that rebuild long prerequisite chains when an
  artifact could prove the prerequisite safely.
- Changes that require broad validation because ownership boundaries are not
  explicit.

Audit sources used for this revision:

- Core static scan and read-only subagent audit of `services/openclaw-core` and
  shared packages.
- Observer UI static scan and read-only subagent audit of HTML, DOM selectors,
  refreshers, runtime actions, and startup polling.
- `nix/scripts` and docs read-only subagent audit of recursive common-checks,
  artifact naming, observer/core drift, and milestone registry coupling.

## Completed Coupling Work

1. Extracted live-provider governance helpers from
   `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-live-provider-runtime-implementation.mjs`.
2. Extracted Phase 115-116 local-read task shell runtime into a focused module.
3. Extracted Phase 111-114 result-envelope creation execution attempt runtime
   into a focused module.
4. Extracted Phase 107-110 result-envelope creation execution runtime into a
   focused module.
5. Extracted Phase 103-106 result-envelope creation runtime into a focused
   module.
6. Externalized the milestone runner registry into
   `nix/scripts/dev-milestone-checks.tsv` with registry validation and
   `@changed` affected-check selection.
7. Added a milestone script taxonomy audit for script counts, registry
   coverage, long filename pressure, and unregistered non-common check scripts.
8. Added a Phase 99-116 live-provider result-envelope milestone manifest that
   statically proves registry rows, phase plans, core wrappers, Observer
   wrappers, and common checks still align with one metadata source.
9. Replaced the 36 Phase 99-116 core/Observer wrapper bodies with a shared
   manifest-driven wrapper helper while preserving every public script filename
   and registry entry.
10. Extended the Phase 99-116 manifest check to derive each phase primary
    registry and verify the repeated common-check registry inputs.
11. Extended the same manifest check to derive and verify the repeated
    route/approved/final-readiness/task-shell status markers in common checks.
12. Extended the manifest check to derive and verify the repeated Phase 99-116
    core/system-heal state artifact filenames in common checks.
13. Extracted the repeated Phase 99-116 common-check environment setup into a
    manifest-driven helper for ports, plan docs, state artifacts, and core /
    Observer URLs.
14. Extracted the repeated Phase 99-116 fast prerequisite reuse setup into a
    bounded helper while preserving each milestone's local service assertions
    and fallback predecessor script.
15. Replaced the hand-written Phase 99-116 core / Observer milestone registry
    rows with manifest-generated registry directives, preserving public check
    names while reducing duplicated TSV wiring.
16. Scoped Unix dev service lifecycle state by explicit run id while preserving
    default legacy state / pid / log compatibility, enabling parallel and batch
    validation without global process killing.
17. Added a Phase 99-102 result-envelope batch validation lane that starts one
    scoped service stack and reuses it across adjacent core and Observer checks.
18. Confirmed `task-executor.mjs` now uses a `NON_RECOVERABLE_TASK_HANDLERS`
    predicate/handler registry instead of the previous long task branch chain.
19. Extracted the Phase 99-115 result-envelope GET route cluster from
    `route-handlers.mjs` into a focused route group module while preserving all
    public endpoint paths and builder names.
20. Extracted the live-provider credential POST route cluster from
    `route-handlers.mjs` into a focused table-driven route group module. The
    main router now delegates these public POST endpoints through one cohesive
    handler while preserving confirm parsing, task / approval serialization,
    raw preflight task envelopes, and response status codes.
21. Extracted the earlier live-provider task / preflight POST route cluster
    into a second focused route group. Both live-provider POST groups now share
    a small confirm-POST response-envelope helper so future route extraction
    does not copy error handling, `{ confirm }` parsing, task serialization, or
    approval serialization.
22. Extracted the Observer/core read-model GET route cluster for capabilities,
    capability invocation history, command transcripts, filesystem changes, and
    filesystem reads into a focused read-only route group. The main router keeps
    mutable capability refresh/invoke routes local while the extracted module
    preserves public endpoint paths, limit semantics, summary serializers, and
    response status codes.
23. Extracted the approval inbox/action route family from the main router into
    a focused approval route module. The module owns `/approvals`,
    `/approvals/summary`, `/approvals/:id/approve`, and `/approvals/:id/deny`
    while preserving status filtering, limit clamping, default actor/reason
    text, approval events, denied-task failure events, task serialization, and
    response status codes.
24. Extracted the operator/control route family into a focused autonomous
    control module. The module owns `/operator/state`, `/operator/step`,
    `/operator/run`, `/control/pause`, `/control/resume`, `/control/takeover`,
    and `/control/stop` while preserving operator loop response shapes, task
    serialization, runtime state responses, phase updates, takeover metadata,
    and task lifecycle events.
25. Extracted the task read/lifecycle route family into a focused task route
    module. The module owns task summary/active/focus/list/detail endpoints,
    task creation, planning, planned execution, direct execution, recovery,
    phase updates, work-view attachment, and completion while preserving task
    events, approval publication hooks, default task input values, recovery
    conflict semantics, execution serialization, and runtime state responses.
26. Extracted the system/body/memory/cloud task POST cluster into a table-driven
    domain task route module. The module owns systemd repair task creation,
    body evidence ledger task shells and append arming, long-term memory write
    task creation, and early cloud-consciousness handoff/provider task shells
    while preserving per-route input shaping, 200/201 status codes, task and
    approval serialization, route-specific evidence fields, and task summaries.
27. Extracted the read-only workspace and plugin review route family into a
    focused workspace/plugin read route module. The module owns workspace
    registry summaries, command proposal read models, OpenClaw migration and
    plugin SDK review routes, tool catalog/manifest-map read models, native
    plugin contract/registry/readiness routes, and their summary projections
    while preserving public paths, query aliases, response field selection, and
    existing 400 error contracts.
28. Extracted the workspace-native operations route family into a focused route
    module. The module owns native workspace text-write, patch-apply,
    source-authored edit, workspace command, and source command draft/task
    routes while preserving draft plan serialization, JSON query parsing,
    strict confirmation handling, 200/201 success codes, 400/404 error
    contracts, serialized task/approval envelopes, and task summaries.
29. Extracted the native-adapter plugin/profile/search-web/workspace-index
    route family into a focused route module. The module owns plugin profile
    and tool catalog readbacks, search-web adapter plans/preflights/sandbox
    readbacks, their approval-gated task creation routes, workspace semantic
    index and symbol lookup routes, and prompt semantics while preserving query
    aliases, limit parsing, 400/404 error contracts, task and approval
    serialization, and public endpoint paths.

These slices reduced live-provider runtime and milestone orchestration coupling
while preserving the public runtime API and existing milestone entry names.

## High-Coupling Hotspots

| Priority | Area | Coupling Evidence | Safe First Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | `nix/scripts` late credential-value/result-envelope phase chain | Phase number, slug, predecessor, artifact path, registry, status marker, docs token, observer token, endpoint, and `next.recommendedSlice` are repeated across the Phase 99-116 chain. Partial fast-prereq reuse means validation speed and evidence quality depend on per-script string wiring. | Introduce a metadata table for Phases 99-116 and keep existing scripts as shims. First proof should statically compare metadata to current script/doc strings, then run representative phases 100, 108, and 116 in full and fast modes. |
| P0 | `services/openclaw-core/src/route-handlers.mjs` | Core HTTP dispatch, proxying, phase route mapping, plugin routes, task POST routes, approval surfaces, and workspace/body routes are all in one request chain. Route tokens must be hand-synced with runtime exports, Observer refreshers, and milestone scripts. Phase 99-115 result-envelope GET routes, both live-provider POST route groups, the Observer/core read-model GET routes, approval inbox/action routes, operator/control routes, task read/lifecycle routes, system/body/memory/cloud task POST routes, read-only workspace/plugin review routes, workspace-native operation routes, and native-adapter plugin/profile/search-web/workspace-index routes are now grouped, but native plugin runtime/task routes, policy/capability mutation routes, early phase/cloud GET routes, proxy/health, and systemd draft routes still live in the main chain. | Continue route group extraction while keeping `registerRoutes(deps)` stable. Next cohesive targets are native plugin runtime/task route groups and policy/capability mutation routes, because each can be moved behind a focused handler without changing endpoint contracts. |
| P0 | `services/openclaw-core/src/task-executor.mjs` | Execution dispatch still imports many `is...Task`/`execute...Task` pairs, but task matching now uses a `NON_RECOVERABLE_TASK_HANDLERS` registry instead of an ordered if/else branch chain. Remaining coupling is the broad import/destructure surface and mixed local executor domains. | Deprioritize branch-chain work; next improvement should split handler groups only when moving a cohesive domain and preserving the registry entry order. |
| P0 | Observer UI startup and panel synchronization (`client-script-startup.mjs`, `server.mjs`, `client-script-config-dom.mjs`, `client-script-refreshers-cloud.mjs`) | Current contracts are internally consistent, but adding one panel requires matching HTML ids, DOM constants, refresh function, startup call, interval, and milestone token checks. Startup hard-codes every refresher twice: initial `await` sequence and `setInterval` registry. | Introduce a refresh descriptor list grouped by surface and generate startup calls/intervals from it. Then add grouped DOM descriptors for one cloud lane while preserving legacy aliases. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-core/src/plan-builder.mjs` | Plugin plans, runtime activation, systemd repair, body evidence, long-term memory, cloud live-provider wiring, policy intent, task creation, approval creation, event publishing, and system-sense fetches share one builder. | Extract the capability registry/invocation slice first: `baseCapabilities`, backend dispatch, result summarization, invocation logging, and registry build behind the same public return names. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-core/src/cloud-live-provider-runtime-implementation.mjs` | Still mixes early live-provider route/task lanes with registry constants, approval gates, task phase mutation, persistence, event publication, and repeated deferred execution envelopes. Recent extraction reduced the worst phase-lane coupling. | Continue lane extraction only where it removes cross-phase coupling. Next cohesive target is Phase 99-102 result-envelope route/task/approved-deferred/final-readiness. Separately consider an approved-deferred lifecycle helper that preserves status strings. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-system-sense/src/server.mjs` | HTTP server, filesystem operations, command execution, process listing, service discovery, health trends, route-aware recommendations, systemd inventory/dependency maps, and body evidence route reviews share one service file. | Extract system-sense domain modules behind stable endpoints: filesystem ops, command/process ops, health/systemd sensing, body-evidence route builders. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-core/src/plugin-review.mjs` | Plugin contract review, source review, native adapter checks, capability planning, runtime activation checks, and policy/approval evidence are bundled together. | Split review surfaces into contract/source/runtime/capability modules. Keep public plugin review methods stable. |
| P1 | `services/openclaw-core/src/task-manager.mjs` | Task serialization manually knows domain-specific extension fields, recovery predicates, phase histories, persistence, and lifecycle events. Every new task family risks adding another top-level serialization field by hand. | Add a local `TASK_EXTENSION_FIELDS` descriptor used by serialization and creation while preserving today's top-level output keys. |
| P1 | `nix/scripts` milestone script taxonomy | The runner registry is externalized, but common/core/observer scripts still grow by hand and include long filenames, unregistered helper checks, and repeated shell wiring. | Use the `milestone-script-audit` artifact as the baseline, then add metadata-generated shims for the repeated Phase 99-116 live-provider chain before deleting or renaming legacy scripts. |
| P2 | `apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-runtime-actions.mjs` | Runtime action handlers combine form reads, fetch calls, approval flows, command/workspace actions, event-to-refresh fan-out, task focus state, and display updates. | Extract an event-to-refresh map and button-action registration table while preserving global function names. |
| P2 | `services/openclaw-core/src/workspace-ops.mjs` | Target resolution, patch parsing, diff preview, proposals, source-derived proposals, policy metadata, task creation, approval, and event publication share one operational surface. | Split pure patch/diff/proposal builders from task materializers. Keep registry strings and task payload shape unchanged. |
| P2 | Shared plugin contract (`packages/shared-types/src/plugin-registry.mjs`, `plugin-contract.mjs`) | Native capability IDs and validators are small but drive plan-builder capability mapping, plugin review, workspace ops, route behavior, executor handling, and milestone assertions. | Move capability descriptors into a data module while preserving `createOpenClawNativePluginRegistry` and exact capability IDs. |

## Deprioritized By Coupling

- Long docs are not refactor targets unless they cause process drift.
- Files under any line threshold are not automatically acceptable.
- Files over any line threshold are not automatically bad when they own one
  cohesive domain and have stable validation.

## Refactor Order

1. Finish reducing active live-provider lane coupling while it remains the
   current development surface.
2. Use the active credential/result-envelope manifest to extract repeated
   assertion helpers so validation no longer depends on hand-repeated docs,
   Observer, and state JSON assertions.
3. Continue splitting `route-handlers.mjs` by domain so future phases do not
   keep editing one router chain.
4. Split `task-executor.mjs` handler groups only after the current route
   extraction work, since the global branch chain has already been replaced by
   a registry table.
5. Add Observer startup/panel/selector descriptors to stop HTML/DOM/refresher/startup
   drift.
6. Add broader milestone phase descriptors and shared assertion helpers to reduce slow,
   recursive, hand-written validation scripts.
7. Split `plan-builder.mjs`, `plugin-review.mjs`, and `openclaw-system-sense`
   after the active provider lane no longer forces changes through the current
   monoliths.

## Minimum Proof For Each Slice

- The extracted boundary has one clear responsibility.
- Public entry points remain stable or are explicitly shimmed.
- No new replacement module bundles unrelated domains.
- `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` pass for JavaScript changes.
- A focused milestone or regression check exercises the moved behavior.
- Validation notes state whether fast prerequisite reuse or full-chain
  validation was used.
