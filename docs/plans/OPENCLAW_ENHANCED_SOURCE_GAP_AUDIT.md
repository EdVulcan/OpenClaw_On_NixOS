# OpenClaw Enhanced Source Gap Audit

Updated: 2026-07-10

This audit compares the current `OpenClaw_On_NixOS` main branch with the
preserved enhanced `openclaw` source reference:

```text
repository: https://github.com/EdVulcan/openclaw-enhanced-source
branch: main
commit: d90b253b0c03191613e45c36b1434078b8788bed
commit title: Preserve enhanced OpenClaw source prototype
```

The enhanced source is a migration reference, not a dependency to vendor into
`OpenClaw_On_NixOS`. The goal is to migrate useful engineering capability into
OpenClaw's policy, approval, audit, recovery, and Observer surfaces.

Do not continue a mechanical Phase 137 cloud/provider/credential wrapper from
this point. Use this audit to select real capability slices.

## Method

Current main branch evidence:

- Main branch contains `76b3151 Record preserved enhanced source reference`.
- Active route is
  [`../OPENCLAW_FORWARD_WORK_DIRECTIVE.md`](../OPENCLAW_FORWARD_WORK_DIRECTIVE.md).
- Historical source-integration evidence is in
  [`OPENCLAW_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_STAGE_PLAN.md`](./OPENCLAW_SOURCE_INTEGRATION_STAGE_PLAN.md).
- Existing implementation evidence was inspected under
  `services/openclaw-core/src/`, `packages/plugin-runtime/src/`,
  `apps/observer-ui/src/`, and `nix/scripts/`.

Exclusion:

- `.serena/cache/typescript/document_symbols.pkl` is historical cache material
  and is excluded from migration analysis.

## Current Absorbed Baseline

`OpenClaw_On_NixOS` has already absorbed many enhanced-source themes as native,
governed surfaces:

- Native plugin contract and registry:
  `packages/plugin-runtime/src/plugin-capability-descriptors.mjs` and
  `packages/plugin-runtime/src/plugin-registry.mjs`.
- Read-only enhanced-source catalog and metadata absorption:
  `sense.openclaw.tool_catalog`,
  `sense.openclaw.workspace_semantic_index`,
  `sense.openclaw.workspace_symbol_lookup`,
  `sense.openclaw.workspace_edit_target_select`,
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool_surface_inventory`,
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.read`,
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.glob`,
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.grep`,
  `sense.openclaw.prompt_pack`,
  `sense.openclaw.plugin_manifest_map`, and
  `plan.openclaw.plugin_capability`.
- Native engineering proposal surface:
  `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.edit_proposal` creates exact-match surgical
  edit proposals and bounded diff previews without applying patches.
- Native engineering edit approval bridge:
  `openclaw-native-engineering-edit-proposal-task-v0` connects reviewed
  `cc_edit` proposal evidence to approval-gated `workspace_patch_apply` tasks
  without approving or executing the patch.
- Native engineering edit execution evidence and closed-loop proof:
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.edit_execution_evidence` links approved
  `workspace_patch_apply` task completion and filesystem write ledger records
  back to `cc_edit` proposal metadata; the closed-loop milestone proves
  read/search, proposal, approval, patch apply, ledger, Observer,
  verification, and recovery together.
- Native engineering loop operator controls:
  Observer buttons create the existing approval-gated edit, write, and
  verification tasks from the engineering panels while preserving manual
  approval and operator-step gates; the controls now accept bounded
  operator-selected edit/write/verification inputs and display task, approval,
  next-step, evidence-route guidance, and completion evidence readback.
- Native engineering loop recovery action draft:
  Observer reads failed verification recovery evidence, drafts an explicit
  `/tasks/:taskId/recover` operator action, and can create a queued recovered
  task through the existing recovery route while preserving approval and
  operator-step gates before any command rerun.
- Native engineering recovery rerun readback:
  After the recovered task is manually approved and executed through the
  existing operator path, Observer reads verification evidence attached to the
  recovered task and keeps source recovery evidence linked to the original
  failed verification task.
- Native engineering prompt work standards:
  `OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_PROMPT_WORK_STANDARDS_PLAN.md` derives
  `openclaw-engineering-work-standards-v0` from native prompt semantics without
  prompt body exposure or task creation.
- Native engineering loop work standards bridge:
  `OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LOOP_WORK_STANDARDS_BRIDGE_PLAN.md` shows those
  standards in the existing Observer Engineering Loop State panel for active
  tasks without adding a backend route or execution path.
- Native engineering verification work standards coverage:
  `OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_VERIFICATION_WORK_STANDARDS_COVERAGE_PLAN.md`
  attaches read-only `verification_evidence_before_report` coverage to the
  existing verification evidence route and Observer renderer without adding
  command execution or another endpoint.
- Native engineering recovery work standards coverage:
  `OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_RECOVERY_WORK_STANDARDS_COVERAGE_PLAN.md`
  carries that coverage into the existing recovery evidence route so failed
  verification can distinguish command failure from missing evidence without
  creating recovery tasks automatically.
- Native engineering write proposal surface:
  `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.write_proposal` maps `cc_write`
  create/overwrite intent into bounded workspace proposal evidence with redacted
  diff metadata, byte counts, content hashes, and no filesystem mutation.
- Native engineering write approval bridge:
  `openclaw-native-engineering-write-proposal-task-v0` connects reviewed
  `cc_write` proposal evidence to approval-gated `workspace_text_write` tasks
  without approving or executing the write.
- Native engineering write execution evidence:
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.write_execution_evidence` links approved
  `workspace_text_write` task completion and filesystem write ledger records
  back to `cc_write` proposal metadata without exposing file content.
- Native engineering verification evidence:
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.verify_evidence` converts governed command
  transcripts into bounded verification evidence attached to completed tasks.
- Native engineering recovery evidence:
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.recovery_evidence` reads failed verification
  evidence and failed source-command task outcomes, classifies recoverability,
  and exposes operator recovery recommendations without creating tasks or
  rerunning commands.
- Native engineering microcompact evidence:
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_context.microcompact_evidence` estimates
  context-budget savings from historical command transcripts without returning
  raw output or mutating runtime messages or persisted logs.
- Native engineering plan/todo evidence:
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_context.plan_todo_evidence` maps
  `cc_plan_enter`, `cc_plan_exit`, and `cc_todo_write` into visible
  task/workbench planning evidence without hidden mode switches, task mutation,
  or `.openclaw/cc-todo.md` writes.
- Native engineering planning workbench state bridge:
  Observer maps selected engineering task plan/todo evidence into Engineering
  Loop State with visible todo counts and current-item hints while keeping
  hidden planning modes, todo-file writes, and task mutation blocked.
- Native engineering plan/todo workbench storage:
  `act.openclaw.engineering_context.plan_todo_workbench_state` stores bounded,
  visible plan/todo state in OpenClaw core state and feeds
  `workbench_storage` back into the existing evidence route without writing
  `.openclaw/cc-todo.md`, mutating tasks, creating approvals, executing
  commands, calling providers, or creating result envelopes.
- Native engineering workbench state restoration:
  Observer can rebuild the latest Engineering Loop State from public core task
  history after reload by classifying edit, write, verification, recovery, and
  planning-workbench task records without creating tasks or executing commands.
- Native engineering workbench state auto-restore:
  Observer startup calls the read-only restoration flow when browser-local loop
  state is empty, preserving continuity after reload without creating tasks,
  approvals, or execution.
- Native engineering LSP evidence:
  `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_evidence` maps `cc_lsp` `check`,
  `definition`, `references`, and `hover` contracts into bounded workspace
  availability evidence without checking binaries, starting servers, opening
  files in LSP, reading source contents into LSP, or sending JSON-RPC.
- Native engineering LSP lifecycle readiness draft:
  `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle` drafts a governed
  workspace-scoped language-server lifecycle action and readiness gates without
  checking binaries, starting servers, creating tasks, creating approvals,
  persisting lifecycle state, reading source contents into LSP, or sending
  JSON-RPC.
- Native engineering LSP supervised lifecycle pilot:
  `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle_task` creates an approval-gated
  lifecycle task, blocks operator execution before approval, records an approved
  binary gate after approval, attaches recovery evidence when the server binary
  is missing, starts and terminates a bounded user-space process supervision
  probe when a mapped server binary exists, records read-only lifecycle state
  for approved start/restart probes, explicit stop actions, recovery outcomes,
  and initialize/shutdown-only handshake evidence. Later LSP slices add approved
  didOpen, single symbol requests, bounded response target selection, explicit
  selected-target native read bridging, and selected-target edit proposal seeding
  while keeping long-lived process pools, provider calls, and network egress
  blocked.
- Native engineering LSP source-transfer proposal:
  `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_source_transfer` reads one bounded
  workspace source file locally, reports the future `textDocument/didOpen`
  metadata, byte count, line count, sha256, and preview, exposes Observer
  visibility, and keeps `didOpen`, source transfer into a language-server
  process, symbol requests, and long-lived process pools blocked.
- Native engineering LSP source-transfer task:
  `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_source_transfer_task` creates an
  approval-gated task from an inspected proposal, re-reads and hash-checks the
  bounded source file after approval, sends initialize plus
  `textDocument/didOpen`, shutdown, and exit to a bounded short-lived process,
  records lifecycle state, and keeps operational symbol requests and long-lived
  process pools blocked.
- Native engineering LSP symbol request proposal:
  `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_symbol_request` reads approved didOpen
  lifecycle state and drafts definition/references/hover JSON-RPC metadata with
  `sent=false`, while operational symbol request execution remains blocked.
- Native engineering LSP symbol request task:
  `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_symbol_request_task` creates an
  approval-gated task from approved didOpen state, re-reads and hash-checks the
  bounded source file after approval, sends exactly one
  definition/references/hover request through a short-lived user-space LSP
  process, records bounded lifecycle state, and keeps long-lived process pools
  blocked.
- Approval-gated workspace mutation:
  `act.openclaw.workspace_text_write` and
  `act.openclaw.workspace_patch_apply`.
- Patch safety:
  exact replacement, multi-hunk replacement, structured line edits, bounded diff
  previews, proposal envelopes, source-derived rationale/check/risk bundles, and
  filesystem ledgering.
- Source-derived command chain:
  command proposal, command plan, approval-gated task materialization, approved
  execution, denial recovery, hardening, persistence, and focused regression.
- Native plugin/search-web chain:
  manifest mapping, candidate contracts, adapter shells, approval/recovery/
  persistence gates, and runtime activation/sandbox contracts.

These are absorbed in OpenClaw's governance model, not as direct copies of the
enhanced `openclaw` modules.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cc_read` | absorbed | `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.read` provides bounded workspace file read with line ranges, content budget, traversal protection, binary/size boundaries, audit, and Observer evidence. | Continue using the native read/search surface; do not import enhanced `FileReadTool.ts`. | Level 1 |

| `cc_write` | absorbed through governed proposal/approval/execution evidence | `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.write_proposal` creates redacted create/overwrite proposal evidence; `openclaw-native-engineering-write-proposal-task-v0` bridges confirmed proposals to approval-gated `workspace_text_write` tasks; `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.write_execution_evidence` reads completed write ledger evidence. | Keep proposal, approval, execution, and recovery separated. Do not migrate raw overwrite semantics as an autonomous default. | Level 1 |
| `cc_glob` | absorbed | `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.glob` performs bounded workspace file discovery with skipped hidden/generated/cache/dependency directories and result caps. | Continue native bounded discovery; do not execute enhanced `GlobTool.ts`. | Level 1 |
| `cc_grep` | absorbed | `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.grep` performs bounded workspace text search with literal/regex mode, include filters, result/output caps, binary skips, audit, and Observer evidence. | Continue native bounded search; do not execute enhanced `GrepTool.ts`. | Level 1 |
| `cc_lsp` | partially absorbed as evidence, lifecycle draft, approval-gated binary gate, bounded process supervision probe, lifecycle state readback, initialize/shutdown handshake, didOpen source-transfer proposal, approval-gated didOpen task, symbol request proposal, approval-gated single symbol request task, bounded target selection, selected-target read bridge, selected-target edit proposal seed, selected-target edit closed-loop proof, selected-target verification handoff, selected-target recovery recommendation handoff, and selected-target recovered verification rerun proof | `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_evidence` maps `check`, `definition`, `references`, and `hover` contracts, reports language/config metadata and server hints, and keeps source-content reads and symbol requests blocked. `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle` drafts a workspace-scoped lifecycle action and readiness gates. `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle_task` creates an approval-gated lifecycle task, proves pre-approval blocking, checks the mapped server binary after approval, records missing-binary recovery evidence, starts and terminates a bounded user-space process supervision probe when a mapped server binary exists, sends initialize/shutdown-only handshake messages for the `handshake` action, and `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle_state` persists read-only start/stop/restart/recovery/handshake/didOpen/symbol-request state. `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_source_transfer` reads one bounded source file locally for proposal preview/hash and future didOpen metadata. `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_source_transfer_task` re-reads and hash-checks after approval, sends didOpen to a bounded short-lived server, and records source-transfer state. `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_symbol_request` drafts definition/references/hover JSON-RPC metadata from approved didOpen state. `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_symbol_request_task` replays approved didOpen setup after approval, sends exactly one selected symbol request, records bounded response-summary metadata, and keeps long-lived process pools blocked. `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_selected_target_read_bridge` maps a completed selected target URI/range into the existing bounded native read/search surface and returns read content only when `includeRead=true` is explicit. `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_selected_target_edit_proposal_seed` turns that bounded selected text into an edit seed and can build a normal edit proposal when replacement text is provided. The LSP milestone now proves that seed can flow through explicit edit task creation, approval, `act.openclaw.workspace_patch_apply`, filesystem ledger, edit execution evidence, bounded readback, explicit source-command verification task creation, approval-gated command execution, verification evidence readback, failed verification recovery evidence, explicit recovery task creation, pre-approval recovery rerun blocking, recovered task approval/execution, successful rerun verification evidence, and source recovery readback. `sense.openclaw.workspace_symbol_lookup` remains separate derived navigation. | Keep the evidence, draft, task bridge, process probe, lifecycle-state readback, handshake evidence, source-transfer proposal, approved didOpen task, symbol proposal, single approved symbol request task, target selection, selected-target read bridge, edit proposal seed, closed-loop edit proof, verification handoff, recovery recommendation handoff, and recovered verification rerun proof in one LSP lane. Defer long-lived process pools, multi-request sessions, provider egress, package installation, and root/system daemon work. | Level 1 now, Level 2 later |
| `cc_verify` | absorbed as evidence | `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.verify_evidence` reads approval-gated command transcripts, capability invocations, and completed task outcomes to produce bounded verification evidence with checks, output budgets, retry-policy metadata, audit evidence, work-standards coverage for `verification_evidence_before_report`, and Observer visibility. `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.recovery_evidence` adds read-only failed-evidence recovery recommendations and carries the work-standards coverage into recovery readback. | Keep actual command execution on the existing approval-gated source/workspace command task path. Do not add ungoverned shell execution or automatic retries. | Level 1 |
| `cc_plan_enter`, `cc_plan_exit`, `cc_todo_write` | absorbed as evidence plus operator-visible workbench state and governed core-state storage | `sense.openclaw.engineering_context.plan_todo_evidence` reads visible task/workbench plan state, maps planning/todo tool semantics, reports todo counts, and exposes Observer evidence without hidden mode switches, task mutation, or `.openclaw/cc-todo.md` writes. `openclaw-native-engineering-planning-workbench-state-v0` bridges that evidence into Engineering Loop State for selected engineering tasks. `act.openclaw.engineering_context.plan_todo_workbench_state` persists bounded visible workbench todos in OpenClaw core state and feeds `todoSource: workbench_storage` back into evidence. | Keep hidden planning mode, `.openclaw/cc-todo.md` file persistence, task mutation, and plan_exit execution transition deferred. | Level 1 |
| `microcompact` | absorbed as evidence | `sense.openclaw.engineering_context.microcompact_evidence` reads command transcript metadata, protects recent engineering evidence by default, and estimates reclaimable context budget without returning raw output or mutating logs. | Keep actual runtime-message compaction deferred until the evidence surface is stable and governed. Do not silently mutate persisted transcript or hide current verification/recovery evidence. | Level 1 |
| Live plugin runtime refresh | absorbed as evidence | `sense.openclaw.plugin_runtime.refresh_evidence` recomputes the native plugin registry read model, reports activation gates, cache invalidation intent, and blocked module-load/runtime-activation boundaries with Observer evidence. | Keep actual module-loader cache invalidation and live activation deferred until a governed loader exists. | Level 1 |
| ACPX/Codex bridge compatibility | partially absorbed | `sense.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.compatibility` maps the enhanced bridge lessons into a native compatibility read model: POSIX `npx`, Windows `npx.cmd`, command override contract, auth isolation boundaries, future NixOS-body ACP bridge scope, Observer visibility, `plan.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_action` proposal drafts, approval-gated `act.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_action` tasks that record approved-deferred boundaries, `plan.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_write` proposals that preview wrapper content/hash with placeholder auth paths, `act.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_write_bridge` tasks that delegate approved previewed wrapper writes to `act.openclaw.workspace_text_write`, `sense.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_write_execution_evidence` readback/recovery recommendations over task and ledger evidence, `plan.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.process_spawn` proposal contracts from approved wrapper-write evidence, approval-gated `act.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.process_spawn_preflight` tasks that check wrapper file/hash without spawning, and `govern.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.live_execution_boundary_review` that keeps live spawn blocked without explicit authorization. | Keep live auth copy, direct unapproved wrapper write/chmod, `npx` execution, ACP process spawn, and provider egress deferred. Do not copy enhanced ACPX runtime as a dependency. | Level 1 |
| Runtime persistence tests | partially absorbed | Main has many task/approval/recovery persistence milestones, and `state.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.session_metadata` now persists bounded ACPX/Codex session metadata with independent sessions, overwrite revisions, missing-session null behavior, restart recovery, secret-key redaction, Observer-visible readback, wrapper/action draft dependency checks, approval-gated task linkage, wrapper write proposal dependency checks, approved wrapper write task state/ledger evidence, read-only recovery recommendation status, process-spawn proposal readiness, approved preflight task state, and live boundary review state through the workspace text-write path. | Reuse the persistence discipline; live supervised ACP/Codex process execution now requires explicit operator authorization before implementation continues. | Level 1 |
| Engineering prompt semantics | partially absorbed as product-visible standards | Project docs and Codex skills encode evidence-first, precise edits, low coupling, and scoped validation. `openclaw-native-prompt-semantics-v0` now derives `openclaw-engineering-work-standards-v0`, mapping prompt/tool signals into Observer-visible standards for plan-before-mutation, diff preview, approval, ledger evidence, patch validation, verification evidence before report, and prompt-content boundaries without exposing prompt bodies. The existing Engineering Loop State panel also reads and displays the standards status for active tasks. | Keep prompt semantics as a standards contract feeding the existing engineering loop; do not add a monolithic prompt wall, automatic approvals, or hidden enforcement. | Level 1 |
| Operator-facing UI refinements | partially absorbed | Observer UI has been decoupled into panels/refreshers/renderers and now exposes parameterized engineering loop controls plus task/approval/evidence guidance, completion readback, explicit recovery action drafts, recovered verification rerun readback, plan/todo workbench state, read-only loop-state restoration from core task history, startup auto-restore when local state is empty, and LSP lifecycle draft visibility, but enhanced chat/tool-card styling is not migrated. | Keep product-native controls; next LSP work should be a cohesive governed supervised lifecycle pilot, not another static readiness shell. Avoid wholesale CSS import. | Level 1 now, Level 2 when work-view is active |
| `HEARTBEAT.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md` identity notes | should not migrate | Main has mission/docs/skills and fixtures that read `TOOLS.md`, but not these identity files as product authority. | Do not copy persona or local setup notes wholesale. Extract only governed context-file concepts after policy review. | Level 1 |

## Capability Findings

### `cc_read`

Enhanced source:

- `FileReadTool.ts` resolves paths against a workspace root, rejects path escape,
  supports `start_line` and `end_line`, caps output to 2000 lines, and returns
  numbered lines with metadata.

Current OpenClaw:

- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.read` provides bounded workspace file read
  with traversal protection, line range controls, file-size/output budgets,
  binary skips, audit evidence, and Observer visibility.
- `sense.openclaw.workspace_semantic_index` and
  `sense.openclaw.workspace_symbol_lookup` remain separate derived read-only
  analysis surfaces.

Classification: absorbed.

Recommendation:

- Continue using the native governed read surface. Do not import or execute
  enhanced `FileReadTool.ts`, and do not add unbounded system-path reads.

### `cc_edit`

Enhanced source:

- `FileEditTool.ts` performs an exact string replacement only when
  `old_string` appears exactly once and returns a diff-style snippet after
  writing.

Current OpenClaw:

- `workspace-patch-utils.mjs` already supports exact replacements, structured
  line edits, multi-hunk validation, overlap rejection, bounded diff previews,
  and unit tests.
- `workspace-ops.mjs` materializes mutation only through approval-gated tasks,
  `act.filesystem.write_text`, filesystem ledgering, and public redaction.
- `openclaw-native-engineering-edit-proposal-task-v0` rebuilds proposal
  evidence, verifies hashes against the patch task draft, and creates a queued
  approval-gated `workspace_patch_apply` task without approving or executing it.
- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.edit_execution_evidence` reads completed
  approved patch task outcomes and filesystem ledger records without applying
  edits or creating approvals.

Classification: absorbed through governed proposal/approval/execution evidence
and closed-loop proof.

Recommendation:

- Do not migrate immediate edit execution. The useful part is the uniqueness
  check and surgical edit ergonomics; OpenClaw's existing approval and ledger
  path should remain authoritative. Future work should improve operator controls
  for the closed loop rather than adding more readiness shells.

### `cc_write`

Enhanced source:

- `FileWriteTool.ts` creates or overwrites a file under the workspace root and
  warns callers to prefer `cc_edit` for existing files.

Current OpenClaw:

- `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.write_proposal` maps create/overwrite intent
  into bounded workspace proposal evidence with redacted diff metadata, content
  hashes, overwrite checks, and Observer visibility.
- `openclaw-native-engineering-write-proposal-task-v0` creates approval-gated
  workspace text write tasks from confirmed proposals without approving or
  executing the mutation.
- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.write_execution_evidence` reads completed
  approved write task outcomes and filesystem ledger records, linking them back
  to engineering write proposal metadata.
- `act.openclaw.workspace_text_write` exists as an approval-gated write path.
- Public task/approval/Observer surfaces expose hashes and byte counts instead
  of raw content.

Classification: absorbed through governed proposal/approval/execution evidence.

Recommendation:

- Keep full write as a high-risk action. Proposal evidence should remain
  separate from the approved, task-based, auditable, and recoverable write path.

### `cc_glob` and `cc_grep`

Enhanced source:

- `GlobTool.ts` provides recursive glob search with ignored noisy directories
  and a result cap.
- `GrepTool.ts` uses `rg` when available, falls back to a Node.js grep, supports
  regex/literal mode, include filters, case sensitivity, path and line evidence,
  and caps results.

Current OpenClaw:

- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.glob` performs bounded workspace file
  discovery with skipped hidden/generated/cache/dependency directories and
  result caps.
- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.grep` performs bounded workspace text search
  with literal/regex mode, include filters, result/output caps, binary skips,
  audit evidence, and Observer readback.

Classification: absorbed.

Recommendation:

- Continue using the native bounded read/search surface. Do not execute the
  enhanced `GlobTool.ts` or `GrepTool.ts` directly.

### `cc_lsp`

Enhanced source:

- `LSPTool.ts` exposes `definition`, `references`, `hover`, and `check`.
- `lsp-manager.ts` starts language servers, caches connections by workspace and
  language, opens files, and garbage-collects idle servers.

Current OpenClaw:

- `sense.openclaw.workspace_symbol_lookup` provides declaration-oriented
  navigation without importing or executing legacy modules.
- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_evidence` maps LSP `check`,
  `definition`, `references`, and `hover` contracts, scans bounded workspace
  metadata for TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python signals, reports config-file
  presence without reading config bodies, and reports server binary names and
  install hints without executing version checks.
- `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle` drafts a governed
  workspace-scoped lifecycle action for start/stop/restart/recover and exposes
  readiness gates for workspace scope, metadata, Observer visibility, audit,
  binary checks, process supervision, state, approval/task bridge, and JSON-RPC.
- `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle_task` creates an approval-gated
  task, blocks operator execution before approval, checks the mapped server
  binary after approval, records task readback, attaches recovery
  recommendation evidence when the binary is missing, and starts then
  terminates a bounded user-space process supervision probe when a mapped server
  binary exists.
- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_lifecycle_state` persists read-only state
  records for approved start/restart probes, explicit stop actions, and
  recovery-required outcomes.
- The `handshake` lifecycle action sends only initialize, shutdown, and exit to
  an approved short-lived process and records bounded transcript metadata.
- `plan.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_source_transfer` reads one bounded
  workspace source file locally, rejects traversal/skipped-path/binary/oversize
  inputs, returns future `textDocument/didOpen` metadata plus hash and preview,
  and renders in Observer without sending `didOpen`.
- `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_source_transfer_task` creates an
  approval-gated source-transfer task, blocks before approval, re-reads and
  hash-checks the file after approval, sends only initialize plus
  `textDocument/didOpen`, shutdown, and exit, and records lifecycle state.
- `act.openclaw.engineering_tool.lsp_symbol_request_task` creates an
  approval-gated symbol request task from approved didOpen state, blocks before
  approval, replays approved didOpen setup after approval, sends exactly one
  selected definition/references/hover request, and records bounded method and
  response-observed metadata.
- It does not implement a long-lived Language Server Protocol process pool, open
  reusable files in a persistent LSP connection, run multi-request symbol
  navigation sessions, keep source content in a long-lived server pool, or
  perform optional language server installation checks.

Classification: partially absorbed as evidence plus lifecycle draft plus
approval-gated binary gate, bounded process supervision probe, lifecycle state
readback, initialize/shutdown handshake evidence, source-transfer proposal,
approval-gated didOpen task, symbol request proposal, and approval-gated single
symbol request task.

Recommendation:

- Keep the current evidence, lifecycle draft, and approval-gated task bridge in
  one Level 1 LSP lane. Extend it next with Observer task controls and readback
  for the approved symbol request path rather than creating another static
  readiness shell, hidden long-lived process, or unapproved request path.

### `cc_verify`

Enhanced source:

- `VerifyCodeTool.ts` dispatches a verification command through an injected
  runtime, captures output, exit code, timeout state, and a retry budget.
- Tests assert that verification goes through the injected runtime and does not
  shell-wrap commands unexpectedly.

Current OpenClaw:

- Source-derived command chains can plan, approve, execute, recover, harden, and
  persist command tasks.
- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.verify_evidence` now reads command
  transcripts, capability invocation records, and completed task outcomes to
  create bounded verification evidence.
- `sense.openclaw.engineering_tool.recovery_evidence` now reads failed
  verification evidence and failed source-command task outcomes to surface
  governed recovery recommendations without invoking them.

Classification: absorbed as evidence.

Recommendation:

- Keep execution on the existing approval-gated command task path. Use the
  native verification evidence surface for command shape, provenance, output
  budget, exit status, timeout flag, retry-policy metadata, and Observer
  display. Use recovery evidence only to guide operator review of existing
  recoverable tasks; do not turn it into an automatic retry path.

### `cc_plan_enter`, `cc_plan_exit`, and `cc_todo_write`

Enhanced source:

- `PlanModeTool.ts` defines explicit planning mode entry/exit and persists a
  checklist to `.openclaw/cc-todo.md`.

Current OpenClaw:

- Core already has tasks, plans, approvals, recovery, and state persistence.
- `sense.openclaw.engineering_context.plan_todo_evidence` now exposes
  planning/todo evidence from visible task/workbench state and bounded query
  fixtures. It reports the `.openclaw/cc-todo.md` target only as a deferred
  boundary and does not write it.

Classification: absorbed as evidence.

Recommendation:

- Keep this evidence-only until a governed workbench storage model exists.
  Avoid hidden agent state that cannot be observed or recovered.

### Microcompact

Enhanced source:

- `microcompact.ts` compresses historical large `toolResult` text blocks in
  memory, protects recent assistant turns, and leaves persisted session logs
  intact.

Current OpenClaw:

- `sense.openclaw.engineering_context.microcompact_evidence` reads command
  transcript metadata and output lengths without returning raw output.
- The evidence surface protects recent command evidence by default, links
  verification/recovery read models, estimates reclaimable context budget, and
  keeps runtime-message and persisted-log mutation disabled.

Classification: absorbed as evidence.

Recommendation:

- Keep the evidence route as the authority before adding any actual LLM-context
  transformation. It must not silently hide current task evidence, approval
  context, recovery context, or verification output.

### Live Plugin Runtime Refresh

Enhanced source:

- `runtime-registry-loader.ts` provides `ensurePluginRegistryLoaded` and
  `refreshActivePluginRegistry`, clears discovery/manifest caches, reloads
  selected plugin scopes, and supports setup-only/channel-scoped options.
- `/plugins install`, enable, and disable paths call live refresh and report
  refresh success or failure to the operator.

Current OpenClaw:

- Native plugin runtime activation, denial recovery, hardening, persistence, and
  adapter contracts exist, but many remain explicitly deferred before actual
  module loading or execution.
- `sense.openclaw.plugin_runtime.refresh_evidence` now recomputes the native
  plugin registry read model, reports activation gates and cache invalidation
  intent, and keeps module import, plugin execution, activation, cache mutation,
  task creation, and approval creation disabled.

Classification: absorbed as evidence.

Recommendation:

- Keep using the evidence route until a governed loader exists. The next step
  is not hidden refresh execution; it is planning/todo evidence or a governed
  loader design that can preserve approval, audit, and recovery boundaries.

### ACPX/Codex Bridge Compatibility

Enhanced source:

- `codex-auth-bridge.ts` prepares isolated Codex auth material, writes a wrapper
  that launches `npx.cmd` on Windows and `npx` elsewhere, preserves selected
  environment semantics, and avoids embedding secret values in wrapper text.
- Tests cover isolated auth copy, wrapper creation, explicit command override,
  and persistence behavior.

Current OpenClaw:

- `OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ACPX_CODEX_BRIDGE_COMPATIBILITY_PLAN.md` adds a native
  compatibility read model and a bounded session metadata persistence store.
- The read model reports command compatibility lessons, auth-isolation
  boundaries, and the future NixOS-body bridge target without reading
  `CODEX_HOME`, copying auth material, writing a wrapper, or starting `npx`.
- The wrapper write bridge now connects previewed wrapper content to the existing
  approval-gated `act.openclaw.workspace_text_write` path. It writes only after
  explicit approval, stores capability history and filesystem ledger evidence,
  and still avoids credential reads, auth copies, chmod, `npx` execution,
  ACP/Codex process spawn, provider calls, network egress, and root/system work.
- `sense.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_write_execution_evidence` reads the
  completed wrapper-write task and filesystem ledger metadata, validates that
  content previews and command args stay unexposed, and returns recovery
  recommendations without creating tasks or executing anything.
- `plan.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.process_spawn` maps a future supervised
  `node`/wrapper launch contract from approved wrapper-write evidence without
  creating tasks, executing `node`/`npx`, spawning ACP/Codex, reading/copying
  auth material, using providers, or using network.
- `act.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.process_spawn_preflight` creates an
  approval-gated preflight task and, after approval, checks the wrapper file and
  content hash without running `node`, executing the wrapper, spawning ACP/Codex,
  reading/copying auth material, chmodding files, using providers, or using
  network.
- `govern.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.live_execution_boundary_review` reads
  completed preflight state and keeps live execution blocked until explicit
  authorization exists for process spawn, auth copy, provider, and network
  boundaries.

Classification: partially absorbed.

Recommendation:

- Preserve the compatibility and secret-isolation lessons. Live supervised
  process execution now requires explicit operator authorization. Keep live auth
  copy, direct unapproved wrapper write/chmod, ACP process spawn, and provider
  egress deferred until explicitly selected.

### Runtime Persistence Tests

Enhanced source:

- ACPX runtime tests cover session load/save, multiple independent sessions,
  missing sessions, and overwrite behavior.
- Runtime registry tests cover scoped loads, configured-channel resolution, and
  cache refresh behavior.

Current OpenClaw:

- The main repo has substantial milestone evidence for task, approval, recovery,
  runtime activation, and provider-lane persistence.
- ACPX/Codex session metadata persistence now covers missing sessions, multiple
  independent sessions, overwrite behavior, secret-key redaction, restart
  recovery through the core state file, and approved wrapper-write linkage to
  capability history plus filesystem ledger evidence and read-only recovery
  recommendation readback.
- Live plugin runtime refresh task evidence now persists approved refresh
  execution readback in task state.

Classification: partially absorbed.

Recommendation:

- Keep the existing persistence discipline. Add focused tests for any future
  auth-copy, chmod, wrapper execution, or process-spawn task before enabling it.

### Engineering Prompt Semantics

Enhanced source:

- `system-prompt.ts` adds Claude Code-style instructions: precise edits over
  full rewrites, verification before report, blast-radius control, planning
  before acting, and concise evidence-backed reporting.
- `pi-tools.ts` directly loads `cc-tools` and exposes summaries for the prompt.

Current OpenClaw:

- Repository skills and route documents already enforce many of these
  engineering standards for Codex project development.
- Product runtime prompt-wall enforcement remains intentionally absent, but
  Observer-verifiable work standards are now derived from prompt/tool signals.

Classification: partially absorbed.

Recommendation:

- Continue using prompt semantics as product-visible work standards for
  proposal rationale, expected checks, verification evidence, and Observer
  readback. Avoid adding another large prompt wall as the primary artifact.

### Operator-Facing UI Refinements

Enhanced source:

- `ui/src/styles/chat/tool-cards.css`, chat layout CSS, and related UI files add
  tool cards, grouped tool rendering, approval overlays, and denser operator
  controls.

Current OpenClaw:

- Observer UI has been decoupled into domain panels, config DOM modules,
  refreshers, renderers, and runtime action modules.
- The exact enhanced UI styling and chat/tool-card interaction layer is not
  migrated.

Classification: partially absorbed.

Recommendation:

- Defer direct UI migration until native engineering tools produce real
  read/search/edit/verify evidence. Then add Observer views for those artifacts,
  not generic styling imports.

### `HEARTBEAT.md`, `SOUL.md`, and `TOOLS.md`

Enhanced source:

- `HEARTBEAT.md` is a heartbeat task/context template.
- `SOUL.md` is a persona and conduct note.
- `TOOLS.md` is a local environment note convention.

Current OpenClaw:

- OpenClaw already has project mission docs, route directives, and Codex skills.
- Some milestone fixtures create `TOOLS.md` for source-command and prompt
  semantics checks, but those are not product identity authority.

Classification: should not migrate.

Recommendation:

- Do not copy these files wholesale. If context files become product features,
  define governed contracts for which files are read, how they are scoped, how
  they are displayed, and how they interact with higher-priority policy.

## Deferred Or Should-Not-Migrate Items

Deferred:

- Unbounded/raw `cc_read` execution outside the native workspace scope,
  content budgets, audit evidence, and Observer visibility.
- Raw enhanced glob/grep execution outside the native bounded read/search
  surface.
- Long-lived LSP process pools, file open notifications, source-content
  transfer, definition/references/hover requests, provider egress, package
  installation, and root/system daemon work until a governed service boundary is
  chosen. The current absorbed surface is evidence, lifecycle readiness draft,
  approval-gated binary gate task, missing-binary recovery readback, bounded
  process supervision probe, lifecycle state readback, and initialize/shutdown
  handshake evidence.
- Verification-command execution until command provenance and completion
  evidence attach cleanly to task records.
- Actual microcompact runtime-message transformation until the evidence route
  proves safe context boundaries.
- Actual live plugin module-loader refresh until a governed loader exists and
  cache invalidation can be approved, audited, and recovered.
- ACPX/Codex bridge work until it is scoped to OpenClaw's NixOS body and ACP
  compatibility needs.

Should not migrate:

- Wholesale `extensions/cc-tools` import as an ungoverned tool bundle.
- Immediate `cc_edit`/`cc_write` mutation outside OpenClaw approval and ledger
  paths; `cc_edit` execution evidence after approved patch completion remains a
  follow-up.
- Hidden prompt-wall replacement as the main way to enforce engineering
  behavior.
- Raw persona or local setup notes from `SOUL.md` and `TOOLS.md` as product
  authority.
- Accidental local state or historical caches from the enhanced source repo.

## Recommended Next Slice

Selected trunk:

```text
Native governed engineering tool surface
```

Latest LSP source-transfer task completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SOURCE_TRANSFER_TASK_PLAN.md
```

It produces:

- A proposal surface showing the source file, byte budget, hash, preview, and
  transfer metadata.
- An approval-gated task that re-reads and hash-checks the file after approval,
  sends only initialize plus `textDocument/didOpen`, shutdown, and exit, and
  records lifecycle/source-transfer state.
- Continued deferral of definition/references/hover execution, provider calls,
  network egress, package installation, long-lived process pools, and
  root/system daemon work.
- No raw file mutation, no provider call, no hidden enhanced-source import, and
  no automatic activation.
- Evidence through focused unit tests plus the existing core/Observer LSP
  milestone pair.

Latest LSP symbol request proposal completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SYMBOL_REQUEST_PROPOSAL_PLAN.md
```

It produces:

- A read-only proposal for the exact definition/references/hover JSON-RPC
  method and params that would be sent after approved didOpen state exists.
- Explicit proof that no operational symbol request is sent by the proposal
  endpoint.

Latest LSP symbol request task completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SYMBOL_REQUEST_TASK_PLAN.md
```

It produces:

- An approval-gated task for the exact definition/references/hover request
  selected from approved didOpen state.
- Explicit approval before any operational symbol request is sent.
- A bounded short-lived LSP process that replays didOpen, sends exactly one
  selected symbol request, records response-observed metadata, and terminates.
- Continued deferral of provider calls, network egress, package installation,
  long-lived process pools, multi-request sessions, and root/system daemon work.

Why this is real progress:

- It advances Level 1, the stable user-space control plane.
- It makes OpenClaw better at governing its own engineering work rather than
  adding another cloud/provider safety shell.
- It sets up the next operator-visible slice: Observer controls and readback for
  the approved LSP symbol request task.

Latest LSP Observer symbol request control completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_OBSERVER_SYMBOL_REQUEST_CONTROL_PLAN.md
```

It produces:

- A visible Observer button that creates the existing approval-gated
  `symbol_request` lifecycle task.
- Engineering Loop State readback through `/tasks/:taskId` showing approval,
  action, symbol request sent status, lifecycle result, and recovery guidance.
- No new route shell, duplicate evidence milestone, automatic approval,
  automatic operator step, provider call, network egress, or long-lived LSP
  pool.

Next smallest real capability:

```text
governed LSP references/hover variants
```

Latest bounded LSP symbol response summary completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SYMBOL_RESPONSE_SUMMARY_PLAN.md
```

It produces:

- Result shape/count metadata from approved single definition/references/hover
  responses.
- URI count, range count, hover content kind/character count, error code, and
  error message character count.
- No raw response payload exposure, raw source body exposure, long-lived pool,
  provider call, network egress, or root/system daemon work.

Latest LSP references/hover variant coverage completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_VARIANT_REQUESTS_PLAN.md
```

It produces:

- Proposal mapping for `references` and `hover`.
- Observer controls for definition, references, and hover tasks through the same
  governed route.
- Bounded response-summary unit coverage for references arrays and hover
  content metadata.
- Continued deferral of raw response payloads, long-lived LSP pools,
  auto-approval, provider calls, and root/system daemon work.

Latest LSP Observer selected-target edit seed control completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_OBSERVER_SELECTED_TARGET_EDIT_SEED_CONTROL_PLAN.md
```

It produces:

- A `Seed Edit Proposal` Observer control over completed LSP lifecycle task
  state.
- Existing edit proposal path/search/replacement inputs populated from the
  bounded selected target seed.
- A separate, still-explicit `Create Edit Task` step for the approval-gated
  mutation path.
- No automatic follow-up task/approval, JSON-RPC, LSP process start, provider
  call, network egress, mutation, or long-lived LSP pool.

Latest LSP selected-target edit closed-loop proof completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SELECTED_TARGET_EDIT_CLOSED_LOOP_PLAN.md
```

It proves:

- Completed LSP selected target metadata can seed an exact edit proposal.
- The edit task is still explicit and approval-gated through
  `act.openclaw.workspace_patch_apply`.
- Approved execution records filesystem ledger evidence and edit execution
  evidence, then bounded readback confirms the target changed.
- No automatic task creation, automatic approval, automatic operator execution,
  provider call, network egress, root/system daemon work, long-lived LSP pool,
  or raw LSP payload exposure is introduced.

Latest LSP selected-target verification handoff completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SELECTED_TARGET_VERIFICATION_HANDOFF_PLAN.md
```

It proves:

- The selected-target edit flow can hand off to an explicit source-command
  verification task.
- Verification remains blocked before approval and uses the existing governed
  command execution path after approval.
- Verification evidence is attached to the completed verification task and
  confirms the selected-target edit result.
- No automatic verification task creation, automatic approval, automatic
  execution, arbitrary shell path, provider call, network egress, root/system
  daemon work, or long-lived LSP pool is introduced.

Latest LSP selected-target recovery recommendation handoff completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SELECTED_TARGET_RECOVERY_RECOMMENDATION_HANDOFF_PLAN.md
```

It proves:

- Failed selected-target verification produces read-only recovery evidence.
- Recovery evidence recommends the existing `/tasks/:taskId/recover` endpoint.
- Explicit recovery task creation queues a recovered source-command task.
- Operator execution of the recovered task remains blocked before approval.
- No automatic recovery task creation, automatic approval, automatic rerun,
  provider call, network egress, root/system daemon work, or long-lived LSP pool
  is introduced.

Latest LSP selected-target recovered verification rerun completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ENGINEERING_LSP_SELECTED_TARGET_RECOVERED_VERIFICATION_RERUN_PLAN.md
```

It proves:

- The recovered source-command task still requires approval.
- The approved recovered task reruns through the existing operator path.
- Successful rerun verification evidence is attached to the recovered task.
- Source recovery readback remains linked to the recovered task.
- No automatic recovery approval, automatic rerun, provider call, network
  egress, root/system daemon work, or long-lived LSP pool is introduced.

Latest live plugin runtime refresh follow-up completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_PLUGIN_RUNTIME_REFRESH_TASK_PLAN.md
```

That slice migrates the enhanced-source runtime refresh idea into an
OpenClaw-native, approval-gated lifecycle action. It creates an explicit task and
approval, blocks before approval, recomputes read-model evidence after approval,
stores execution evidence in task readback, and still avoids module imports,
plugin code execution, runtime activation, cache mutation, provider egress, and
root/system daemon work.

Latest ACPX/Codex bridge compatibility follow-up completed:

```text
OPENCLAW_NATIVE_ACPX_CODEX_BRIDGE_COMPATIBILITY_PLAN.md
```

It maps the enhanced-source bridge and persistence tests into OpenClaw-native
compatibility evidence, a bounded persisted session metadata store, proposal
drafts, approval-gated wrapper action tasks, wrapper write proposals, an
approval-gated wrapper write bridge through the existing workspace text-write
path, and wrapper write execution readback/recovery recommendations without
copying the reference runtime, reading credentials, copying auth material,
running chmod, executing wrappers, spawning ACP processes, or performing
provider egress. It also maps a process-spawn proposal contract from approved
wrapper-write evidence and an approval-gated preflight task without executing
the wrapper or spawning ACP/Codex. The live boundary review keeps actual spawn
blocked pending explicit operator authorization.

Next smallest real capability:

```text
Explicit operator authorization for live ACP/Codex process execution
```

That is intentionally blocked for autonomous development because it would
involve real local process execution and likely auth/provider/network
boundaries. Continue another safe native engineering capability unless the
operator explicitly authorizes those boundaries.

Required answer for every following slice:

- What real user/operator-visible capability became more concrete?
- Which identity level does it serve?
- Where is the evidence?
- What remains deliberately deferred?
- What is the next smallest real capability?
