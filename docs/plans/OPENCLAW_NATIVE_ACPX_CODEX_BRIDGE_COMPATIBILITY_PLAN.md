# OpenClaw Native ACPX/Codex Bridge Compatibility Plan

Updated: 2026-07-10

## Active Slice

ACPX/Codex bridge compatibility, runtime persistence evidence, Observer
visibility, wrapper/action proposal draft, approval-gated wrapper action task
bridge, wrapper write proposal/preview, approval-gated wrapper write bridge
through the existing workspace text-write path, and wrapper write execution
readback/recovery recommendation, and process-spawn proposal contract.

This slice migrates the useful enhanced-source ACPX/Codex bridge lessons into
OpenClaw-native Level 1 behavior:

```

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Implemented Behavior

The compatibility read model records:

- POSIX `npx` and Windows `npx.cmd` command compatibility lessons
- future ACP/Codex bridge target scoped to the NixOS body
- command override support as a contract, not an executed wrapper
- explicit auth isolation boundaries
- session metadata persistence status
- selected-session readback and missing-session null behavior
- Observer-visible compatibility, auth-isolation, runtime-blocked, and session
  persistence state

The session persistence store records bounded metadata for future ACPX/Codex
sessions:

- independent session keys
- overwrite revision increments
- restart persistence through the core state file
- secret-like metadata key redaction
- no credential value reads
- no auth material copies
- no wrapper writes
- no `npx` or ACP process spawn
- no provider/network egress

Passive Observer refresh exposes the existing read model without creating tasks,
approvals, wrapper files, ACP/Codex processes, provider calls, or network egress.
Explicit operator buttons can create the approval-gated wrapper action task or
wrapper write task; they still do not approve or execute those tasks.

The wrapper/action draft route creates a proposal-only bridge action shape for a
selected persisted session. It records the planned wrapper-relative path,
command shape, auth-isolation boundary, readiness gates, and future approval
requirements without creating a task or approval.

The wrapper action task route creates an approval-gated task from a reviewed
draft. Operator execution blocks before approval. After approval, the executor
records an approved-deferred boundary and completes with explicit evidence that
no wrapper file was written, no credential value was read, no auth material was
copied, no `npx` command was executed, no ACP/Codex process was spawned, and no
network/provider egress occurred.

The wrapper write proposal route derives the planned wrapper-relative path,
Node wrapper content preview, content hash, file/directory mode expectations,
and future `act.openclaw.workspace_text_write` boundary. It uses an explicit
`__OPENCLAW_APPROVED_CODEX_HOME__` placeholder and does not read real
`CODEX_HOME`, read `auth.json` or `config.toml`, copy auth material, create
directories, write the wrapper file, run `chmod`, execute `npx`, spawn ACP/Codex,
call providers, or use network.

The wrapper write task route connects that reviewed proposal to the existing
approval-gated `act.openclaw.workspace_text_write` path. Task creation returns
only metadata, content hash, and approval state; it does not expose the wrapper
content preview in the public task response. Operator execution blocks before
approval. After approval, the normal workspace text-write capability writes the
previewed user-space wrapper file under the bounded workspace root and records
capability history plus filesystem ledger evidence. It still does not read real
Codex credentials, copy auth material, create/chmod the wrapper directory,
execute `npx`, spawn ACP/Codex, call providers, use network, or require root.

The wrapper write execution readback route reads completed wrapper-write task
metadata plus filesystem ledger records and returns validation checks with a
recovery recommendation. It does not create recovery tasks, approve work,
execute operator steps, write files, read credentials, copy auth material,
chmod wrappers, execute wrappers, spawn ACP/Codex, call providers, or use
network.

The process-spawn proposal route consumes approved wrapper-write execution
evidence and maps the future supervised launch contract: wrapper-relative path,
content hash, future `act.system.command.execute` boundary, approval
requirement, and preconditions. It does not create tasks or approvals, execute
the wrapper, run `node`/`npx`, spawn ACP/Codex, read/copy auth material, call
providers, or use network.

## Governance

Capability mapping:

```text
ACPX/Codex bridge compatibility -> sense.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.compatibility
ACPX runtime persistence tests -> state.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.session_metadata
ACPX/Codex wrapper/action draft -> plan.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_action
ACPX/Codex wrapper/action task -> act.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_action
ACPX/Codex wrapper write proposal -> plan.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_write
ACPX/Codex wrapper write approval bridge -> act.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_write_bridge
Delegated approved write -> act.openclaw.workspace_text_write
ACPX/Codex wrapper write execution readback -> sense.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.wrapper_write_execution_evidence
ACPX/Codex process-spawn proposal -> plan.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.process_spawn
```

This is intentionally not a live bridge execution path. It creates a native
compatibility contract and persistence primitive that later bridge work can
depend on.

```

## Deferred

The following remain deferred:

```text
CODEX_HOME read
auth.json/config.toml read
auth material copy
direct unapproved wrapper file write
wrapper directory creation or chmod
npx/npx.cmd execution
ACP/Codex process spawn
provider calls
network egress
root/system daemon work
```

## Next Smallest Real Capability

The next smallest useful bridge follow-up is:

```text
ACPX/Codex bridge process-spawn approval task design
```

That should remain approval-gated and may initially record an approved-deferred
or preflight-only boundary. It must not execute the wrapper, spawn ACP/Codex,
read/copy auth material, chmod files, call providers, or use network egress
until the execution boundary is explicitly selected and validated.
