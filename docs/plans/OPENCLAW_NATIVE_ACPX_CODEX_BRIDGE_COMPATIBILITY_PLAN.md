# OpenClaw Native ACPX/Codex Bridge Compatibility Plan

Updated: 2026-07-10

## Active Slice

ACPX/Codex bridge compatibility, runtime persistence evidence, and Observer
visibility.

This slice migrates the useful enhanced-source ACPX/Codex bridge lessons into
OpenClaw-native Level 1 behavior:

```text
GET /plugins/native-adapter/acpx-codex-bridge-compatibility
POST /plugins/native-adapter/acpx-codex-session-records
Observer panel: OpenClaw ACPX/Codex Bridge
```

Identity alignment: Level 1, stable user-space control plane.

## Implemented Behavior

The compatibility read model records:

- POSIX `npx` and Windows `npx.cmd` command compatibility lessons
- future ACP/Codex bridge target scoped to the NixOS body
- command override support as a contract, not an executed wrapper
- explicit auth isolation boundaries
- session metadata persistence status
- selected-session readback and missing-session null behavior
- Observer-visible compatibility, auth-isolation, runtime-blocked, and session
  persistence state

The session persistence store records bounded metadata for future ACPX/Codex
sessions:

- independent session keys
- overwrite revision increments
- restart persistence through the core state file
- secret-like metadata key redaction
- no credential value reads
- no auth material copies
- no wrapper writes
- no `npx` or ACP process spawn
- no provider/network egress

Observer now exposes the existing read model without creating tasks, approvals,
wrapper files, ACP/Codex processes, provider calls, or network egress.

## Governance

Capability mapping:

```text
ACPX/Codex bridge compatibility -> sense.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.compatibility
ACPX runtime persistence tests -> state.openclaw.acpx_codex_bridge.session_metadata
```

This is intentionally not a live bridge execution path. It creates a native
compatibility contract and persistence primitive that later bridge work can
depend on.

## Evidence

Core builder:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/native-acpx-codex-bridge-builders.mjs
```

State persistence:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/runtime-state.mjs
acpxBridgeSessionRecords
```

Route wiring:

```text
services/openclaw-core/src/native-adapter-plugin-routes.mjs
```

Observer visibility:

```text
apps/observer-ui/src/observer-panels-operations.mjs
apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-config-dom-workspace-source.mjs
apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-refreshers-workspace-source.mjs
apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-renderers-acpx-codex-bridge.mjs
apps/observer-ui/src/client-script-startup-refreshes.mjs
```

Validation target:

```text
services/openclaw-core/test/native-acpx-codex-bridge-builders.test.mjs
services/openclaw-core/test/native-adapter-plugin-routes.test.mjs
openclaw-native-acpx-codex-bridge-compatibility
observer-openclaw-native-acpx-codex-bridge-compatibility
```

## Deferred

The following remain deferred:

```text
CODEX_HOME read
auth.json/config.toml read
auth material copy
wrapper file write
npx/npx.cmd execution
ACP/Codex process spawn
provider calls
network egress
root/system daemon work
```

## Next Smallest Real Capability

The next smallest useful bridge follow-up is:

```text
ACPX/Codex bridge wrapper/action proposal draft
```

That should remain a proposal-only or approval-bridge slice until a governed
wrapper write and process-spawn boundary is explicitly selected. It must not
read real Codex credential values, copy auth material, execute `npx`, spawn an
ACP/Codex process, or use provider/network egress.
