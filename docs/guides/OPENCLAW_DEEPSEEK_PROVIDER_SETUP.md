# DeepSeek Provider Setup

The live provider sender is disabled by default. It accepts only the DeepSeek
OpenAI-compatible endpoint and reads the API key from the process environment.
The key is never part of repository files, task evidence, or command output.

Configure a temporary shell session:

```bash
export OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT='https://api.deepseek.com'
export OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_MODEL='deepseek-chat'
read -r -s -p 'DeepSeek API key: ' OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_API_KEY
printf '\n'
export OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_API_KEY
export OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_LIVE_EGRESS=true
```

Run one bounded connectivity check only when the request is explicitly
authorized:

```bash
node nix/scripts/dev-openclaw-cloud-consciousness-live-provider-one-shot.mjs --confirm-live-call
```

The command prints only the bounded model response and redacted audit metadata.
Clear the variables when finished:

```bash
unset OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT
unset OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_MODEL
unset OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_API_KEY
unset OPENCLAW_CLOUD_PROVIDER_LIVE_EGRESS
```

This one-shot lane does not turn on automatic provider calls for OpenClaw
tasks. The existing task and Observer lanes remain approval-gated and deferred.
